## Magicite Crystals

Magicite crystals are a natural phenomenon that has been observed near and within the Great Chasm of Wellspring. They are believed to be formed when excess mana crystallizes out of the air.

Visually, magicite appears as irregular, translucent crystals which glow with an inner radiance. They can range in size from large grains of sand to entire crystal formations the size of stalagmites. Most magicite discovered is cracked, with broken crystalline structure and an irregular glow. Intact magicite is rare and highly valued, both by adventurers who delve beneath Wellspring in search of it, and by monsters who are often drawn to its beauty or its magical emanations.

Magicite is largely responsible for the modern reniassance Wellspring is currently experiencing, after the destruction of the Sherem Wars. Using a combination of ritual magic and alchemy, scholars at the Arcane Order have discovered how to use intact magicite crystals during the creation and enchantment of magical items and artifacts, allowing them to bypass the sacrifice of personal energies usually required for a permanent creation. The process is closely guarded, and the sale of magical or enchanted items is a source of considerable wealth.

## The Four Arcana

The Four Arcana is the dominant model of magic among arcanists and scholars, derived from the cosmology of the Sherem magocracy. It represents the natural cycle of magic, and is reflected [in the very heavens]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/daily-life#celestial-bodies).

Imagine a graph with two axes, labelled Order-Disorder and Creation-Destruction; these are the basic philosophical principles that underlie magic. The two axes divide the space into four equal parts, each of which corresponds to a unique pairing of those principles.

### The Sacred Arcanum

The Sacred Arcanum is the domain of the heavens, of celestial beings, and of light magic. It is represented by the quadrant of Order and Creation. Sacred magic is strong against the Death arcanum, but weak against the Nature arcanum. Entities aligned with the Sacred Arcanum tend to be altruistic and cooperative but rigid and inflexible.

### The Profane Arcanum

The Profane Arcanum is the domain of the hells, of infernal beings, and of dark magic. It is represented by the quadrant of Disorder and Destruction. Profane magic is strong against the Nature arcanum, but weak against the Death arcanum. Entities aligned with the Profane Arcanum tend to be selfish and destructive, but adaptable and individualistic.

### The Nature Arcanum

The Nature Arcanum is the domain of the fey, not of the natural world but of the hyper-natural. It is represented by the quadrant of Disorder and Creation. Nature magic is strong against the Sacred arcanum, but weak against the Profane arcanum.

[Back to Top](#) \| [Back to the Four Arcana](#the-four-arcana)

### The Death Arcanum

The Death Arcanum is the domain of the undead, of the final end to all things. It is represented by the quadrant of Order and Destruction. Death magic is strong against the Profane arcanum, but weak against the Sacred Arcanum.

### Other Magics

While the four Arcana form the core of most theories of creation, there are intense scholarly debates as to how other magics fit into this schema.

- The most common approach names the Sacred, Profane, Nature, and Death arcana as the "major" arcana, while elemental magic, illusions, abjuration, oneiromancy, and other magics constitute the "minor" arcana.
- A more classical approach ties the each of four arcana to one of the primary elements. The Sacred arcanum is associated with water, the Profane with fire, Nature with air, and Death with earth. The ancient druids of what is now the Sapphire Coast in northerly Amaranth used this equivalency to build their temples.
- A competing approach "combines" the four arcana with the four classical elements. The Nature arcanum combines with fire to form a wood element and with air to form a lightning element, while the Death arcanum combines with water to form an ice element and earth to form a metal element. The Sacred and Profane elements, being separated from the earthly plane, are each reflected by a "spiritual" element, the radiant and umbral elements respectively. This theorum is popular among scholars of the planes.

A few radical scholars speak of other, "missing" arcana. Philosophers debating a Balance arcanum encompassing elemental magic (as magic in its most primordial form) are considered tiresome but harmless, while those who whisper of a Dream arcanum including enchantments, illusions and oneiromancy are dismissed (rarely without cause) as raving madmen.

## The Planes of Existence

The ancient giants discovered that this world was one of many, connected by magic and with wildly different properties and natures. They built [runic gates](#the-runic-gates) channeling immense energies to knit together an empire that gathered spoils across entire realms of existence, before their defeat against the dwarves in the Wars of Stone. Entire peoples and lineages have wandered into Myriad through those decaying gates, and their study has been continued by the ancient high elves, by the Sherem, and by recent organizations such as the Watchers of the Stars and the Planar Cartography Society.

The Watchers of the Stars in particular claim a deep connection between the planes of existence and [the four moons in the sky]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/daily-life#celestial-bodies). As the moons wax and wane, so too do the connections with different realms.

### The Ethereal Plane

A ghostly realm closely tied to our own, but at a metaphysical remove, as if viewing reality through a foggy pane of glass. Travelling through the Ethereal can allow the powerful to bypass obstacles or spy on the material plane, but at the risk of encountering strange and dangerous creatures that call the Ethereal their home. Those who travel "deeper" into the Ethereal find themselves farther from material reality, but those who venture into the Deep Ethereal rarely return.

Every plane has an Ethereal reflection, from the smallest demiplane to the most distant celestial realm. Some claim that if you venture "deep" enough, these reflections merge, allowing transit between far-flung parts of the multiverse, but such stories are far from proven. Even less credible are those who say that lost in the Deep Ethereal are fragments of worlds tied to the past or to the future.

### The Feywild

A twisting labyrinth of lethal beauty and enchantment, often tied to the [Nature arcanum](#the-nature-arcanum). The Feywild is the domain of fae and faeries of all shapes and descriptions, from wild goblin camps to the courts of the eladrin lords, faerie kin of the elves who rule over much of the Feywild. The plane itself is a dizzying mosaic of impossible landscapes, with poisonously beautiful forests next to icy tundras and erupting volcanoes.

The Feywild can be navigated but not mapped. Travellers can follow directions from one landmark to another (so long as they avoid mischievous or "helpful" locals), but trying to plot that same course on paper results in contradictory or even impossible maps, and often different each journey or as recorded by each traveller. However, those who know the path or can bargain for a trustworthy guide can use the Feywild to travel vast distances quickly, or even venture to other planes, as the Feywild touches all of them.

> **From Cyrene's Notes**
>
> Creatures of the Feywild are driven to mischief and chaos. Like demons, but without the innate destructive urges. The more powerful the fey, the more they are bound by rules agreed and bargains struck, but beware of tricks, loopholes, and illusions.

### The Shadowfell

In contrast, the Shadowfell is a bleak realm of death and entropy, tied to the [Death arcanum](#the-death-arcanum). Forbidding mountains, vast deserts, quicksand swamps, and forests of dead wood abound, filled with denizens that delight in despair and destruction. The souls of the dead are said to travel across the Shadowfell en route to their final destination, and it is said that at the realm's heart is a city built around a gate to the afterlife. Those souls that stray from the path often become monsters, waiting to feed on the unwary who venture where they should not.

If the hazards of the greater Shadowfell were not bad enough, the realm also contains many subrealms or demesnes, each with their own logic and dangers. Some serve as domains or prisons for ancient evils, while others contain reflections of some unspeakable horror, such as a town devoured by the undead, forced to relive its destruction every nightfall. Few travellers come to the Shadowfell willingly, or without great need, but places steeped in death and darkness may find the unwary stumbling into shadows deeper than they knew.

### The Celestial Realms

The realms of the celestial, tied to the [Sacred arcanum](#the-sacred-arcanum), are shining, beautiful, and forbidden. Only the most devout servants of the light, the most faithful, the most resolute through a lifetime of thankless toil are permitted to set foot in the heavens save at the invitation and patronage of a higher power. While the poets wax rhapsodical about the glory and beauty of the celestial realms, it is a sight few are ever privileged to see.

> **From Cyrene's Notes**
>
> Celestials are all about rules. And rules are important! But they're not the only thing that's important.

### The Infernal Realms

The infernal realms, tied to the [Profane arcanum](#the-profane-arcanum), are a twisted morass of barren plains, sulfurous peaks, and rivers of molten rock. Even the air is harsh and corrosive, and simple necessities like potable water or non-poisonous food are rare luxuries, viciously fought over by the denizens of the hells. Scholars classify those into two categories: demons are simple beasts, if warped by the unremittingly harsh environment. Devils are intelligent, thinking people, and for that all the more dangerous.

> **From Cyrene's Notes**
>
> Demons (and devils) are creatures of wants and desires. A devil of intellect desires knowledge, a devil of lust wants...well, you know. And a hungry demon wants to eat your face.

[Back to Top](#) \| [Back to the Planes of Existence](#the-planes-of-existence)

### The Astral Plane

The Astral Plane is an endless void of floating rocks and forgotten things, fallen into the empty places between other planes. All other planes can be reached from the right places in the Astral and vice versa, but travel through the vast emptiness carries its own dangers, from bands of githyanki raiders to stellar dragons to cabals of mind flayers. Like the Ethereal Plane, the Astral has depths, and the foolhardy few who brave the heart of the Astral Plane and return bring stories of lost cities and the corpses of dead gods floating in the aether. Some scholars claim the Astral Plane also has a connection to dreams, and practitioners of oneiromancy can learn the ability to walk the Astral in their sleep, viewing or even traveling to far-off places.

### Material Planes

The world of Myriad is a plane of its own, and known not to be the only one of its kind. At least twice in the past, decaying [runic gates](#the-runic-gates) have linked Myriad to realms unknown to any local cosmology; first [the home of the elves and halflings]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/history#the-age-of-bronze), and then the [homeland of the humans, goblins, and hobgoblins]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/history#the-age-of-iron). If these places can still be found, none living know the path.

### Minor Planes

In addition to the major planes above, there are innumerable smaller realms, with their own internal logic and properties. Smaller planes are defined by finite boundaries, and may or may not be chartable or navigable. Known minor planes include:

The Bubbling Caverns
: A hellscape of fire and molten rock. The surface burns in eternal sunlight, and most life exists in the labyrinth of volcanic caverns beneath. Rival cities of azer dwarves and salamanders maintain an eternal war over the rich veins of metals left behind by flows of magma.

The Crystal Glaciers
: A frozen icescape of crystalline spires. A single fading volcanic hotspot hosts a city of exiles, while wild elves roam the tundra herding dire wolves and giant elk. Rare herbs grown beside meltwater streams provide unique opportunities for botanists and alchemists willing to dare the apocalyptic blizzards that sweep the landscape.

The Shadowlit Spires
: A patchwork landscape of volcanic fire and glacial ice, "lit" by a shadowed anti-sun that drains both heat and vitality. Glaciers flow through the lowlands to frozen seas, although scattered pockets of life cling to geothermal springs. In the peaks, warlike salamanders build canals of lava and fortresses of obsidian. The ashen highlands are dotted with sulfurous vents and rivers of molten rock - but at night, away from baleful anti-light of the sun, seemingly petrified forests bloom with crimson leaves, and golden wildflowers emerge from the ash to soak up starlight.

### Pockets and Demiplanes

Smaller still than the minor planes are demiplanes or pocket dimensions. Rarely stable on their own, they are usually created and anchored by some magical artifact, from the interior of a *bag of holding* to a dimensional mansion hidden inside a book. Demiplanes are usually closely tied to their origin, and if improperly warded can be accessed through the Ethereal Plane as well as their intended entrance.

## The Runic Gates

The Runic Gates are the defining feature of the world of Myriad (literally, the world of the 10,000 gates). Remnants of the ancient empire of the Giants, these stone circles were created in the depths of antiquity by Giantish crafters at the peak of their skills.

Gates were created for three purposes. The most common gates were paired, allowing for near-instanteous travel between distant parts of the world for a minor expenditure of magic. If any such gate pair still exists and functions, it is not widely known. Rarer were the gates linking Myriad to other planes of existence, where the Giants built outposts to gather rare resources or even full colonies. The rarest form of gates were variable, able to change their destination at the Giant's will. If such a feat could be repaired or replicated, the consequences for the people and nations of Myriad could be profound.

Each gate was carved with delicate runes and laid with powerful enchantments, and many gates survive almost intact despite the millenia. Unfortunately, with magic this delicate and powerful, very few gates maintain any sort of function. Explorers are well advised to avoid using newly rediscovered gates, as even those that appear to function may send travellers far afield at random, including to hostile destinations such as high in the sky, at the bottom of the sea, or the heart of a volcano.

The few known surviving gates are planar gates, but here another problem arises - like the stars in the sky, the planes of existence are not fixed over the millenia. Between damage, decay, and planar drift, few gates still connect to a destination at all, and fewer still to their original plane, let alone a location within. Scholars believe that drifting planar gates are how many of the peoples of Myriad came to this world from their now-lost homelands.

## The Well of Divinity

The [Gods of Myriad]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/religion) were mortal once. (Or so it is said by some. Others believe this to be base heresy, so tread with caution.) Each was the master of his, her, or their domain. Driven by ambition or necessity to excel in an aspect of philosophy, might, or magic, the would-be deity sought and achieved the pinnacle of mortal ability - and for the most fleeting of instants, gained a glimpse beyond. Sometimes that spark of divinity fades; sometimes, honed by that same driving need that first afforded a glimpse beyond the veil of mortality, the spark is cultured and grows.

Every story is different, but here they converge into one. On the eve of their greatest triumph, their peak of achievement or insight, the mortal comes to a place of decision. It is a liminal place, not truly of this world, and so belongs to no nation or territory, can be found on no true maps. Sometimes a well by the side of the road, or a fountain of crisp, clean water; perhaps it is the taproom of a tavern long since lost, or the gathered blood of a greatest foe, but always the same choice is given - to drink, or to walk away. This is the Well of Divinity.

Those who choose to walk away return to their mortal lives, strangely reluctant to share their experience. In time, the spark of divinity gutters out, though the heights a mortal can achieve without it are towering indeed. But the Well comes only once. Those who choose to drink are uplifted, exalted, the divine spark within them roaring into a mighty flame. But all magic comes at a price, and the cost of divinity is a steep one indeed - the sacrifice of all mortal ambition, the loss of that greatest achievement. To the mortal world, the newborn deity simply vanishes.

Over time, the newborn deity grows in power and potential, a process that can be revealed by various signs and portents visible to diviners and to those sensitive to such energies. Finally, some unknown period of time later, comes the Revelation, a vision of the new god's awakening given to those who are receptive to the deity's domain and philosophy. These become the core of the new faith's priesthood. Depending on the deity's nature, a Revelation may make its mark on the world as well, typically in the form of a general blessing, boon, or bane. The Revelation of a goddess of fire may result in charcoal and firewood burning for far longer than normal, or conversely trigger a crippling drought. Potential signs of a pending Revelation are therefore carefully examined and hotly debated.
