## Magicite Crystals

Magicite crystals are a natural phenomenon that has been observed near and within the Great Chasm of Wellspring. They are believed to be formed when excess mana crystallizes out of the air.

Visually, magicite appears as irregular, translucent crystals which glow with an inner radiance. They can range in size from large grains of sand to entire crystal formations the size of stalagmites. Most magicite discovered is cracked, with broken crystalline structure and an irregular glow. Intact magicite is rare and highly valued, both by adventurers who delve beneath Wellspring in search of it, and by monsters who are often drawn to its beauty or its magical emanations.

Magicite is largely responsible for the modern reniassance Wellspring is currently experiencing, after the destruction of the Sherem Wars. Using a combination of ritual magic and alchemy, scholars at the Arcane Order have discovered how to use intact magicite crystals during the creation and enchantment of magical items and artifacts, allowing them to bypass the sacrifice of personal energies usually required for a permanent creation. The process is closely guarded, and the sale of magical or enchanted items is a source of considerable wealth.

## The Four Arcana

The Four Arcana is the dominant model of magic among arcanists and scholars. It represents the natural cycle of magic, and is reflected [in the very heavens]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/daily-life#celestial-bodies).

Imagine a graph with two axes, labelled Order-Disorder and Creation-Destruction; these are the basic philosophical principles that underlie magic. The two axes divide the space into four equal parts, each of which corresponds to a unique pairing of those principles.

### The Sacred Arcanum

The Sacred Arcanum is the domain of the heavens, of celestial beings, and of light magic. It is represented by the quadrant of Order and Creation. Sacred magic is strong against the Death arcanum, but weak against the Nature arcanum. Entities aligned with the Sacred Arcanum tend to be altruistic and cooperative but rigid and inflexible.

### The Profane Arcanum

The Profane Arcanum is the domain of the hells, of infernal beings, and of dark magic. It is represented by the quadrant of Disorder and Destruction. Profane magic is strong against the Nature arcanum, but weak against the Death arcanum. Entities aligned with the Profane Arcanum tend to be selfish and destructive, but adaptable and individualistic.

### The Nature Arcanum

The Nature Arcanum is the domain of the fey, not of the natural world but of the hyper-natural. It is represented by the quadrant of Disorder and Creation. Nature magic is strong against the Sacred arcanum, but weak against the Profane arcanum.

### The Death Arcanum

The Death Arcanum is the domain of the undead, of the final end to all things. It is represented by the quadrant of Order and Destruction. Death magic is strong against the Profane arcanum, but weak against the Sacred Arcanum.

### The Arcana And Elemental Magic

At the center, equally balanced between creation and destruction and between order and disorder is elemental magic. This is magic in its most primordial form. Some refer to this as the Balance Arcanum, but adherents of this philosophy are a decided minority.

## The Runic Gates

The Runic Gates are the defining feature of the world of Myriad (literally, the world of the 10,000 gates). Remnants of the ancient empire of the Giants, these stone circles were created in the depths of antiquity by Giantish crafters at the peak of their skills.

Gates were created for three purposes. The most common gates were paired, allowing for near-instanteous travel between distant parts of the world for a minor expenditure of magic. If any such gate pair still exists and functions, it is not widely known. Rarer were the gates linking Myriad to other planes of existence, where the Giants built outposts to gather rare resources or even full colonies. The rarest form of gates were variable, able to change their destination at the Giant's will. If such a feat could be repaired or replicated, the consequences for the people and nations of Myriad could be profound.

Each gate was carved with delicate runes and laid with powerful enchantments, and many gates survive almost intact despite the millenia. Unfortunately, with magic this delicate and powerful, very few gates maintain any sort of function. Explorers are well advised to avoid using newly rediscovered gates, as even those that appear to function may send travellers far afield at random, including to hostile destinations such as high in the sky, at the bottom of the sea, or the heart of a volcano.

The few known surviving gates are planar gates, but here another problem arises - like the stars in the sky, the planes of existence are not fixed over the millenia. Between damage, decay, and planar drift, few gates still connect to a destination at all, and fewer still to their original plane, let alone a location within. Scholars believe that drifting planar gates are how many of the peoples of Myriad came to this world from their now-lost homelands.

## The Well of Divinity

The [Gods of Myriad]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/religion) were mortal once. (Or so it is said by some. Others believe this to be base heresy, so tread with caution.) Each was the master of his, her, or their domain. Driven by ambition or necessity to excel in an aspect of philosophy, might, or magic, the would-be deity sought and achieved the pinnacle of mortal ability - and for the most fleeting of instants, gained a glimpse beyond. Sometimes that spark of divinity fades; sometimes, honed by that same driving need that first afforded a glimpse beyond the veil of mortality, the spark is cultured and grows.

Every story is different, but here they converge into one. On the eve of their greatest triumph, their peak of achievement or insight, the mortal comes to a place of decision. It is a liminal place, not truly of this world, and so belongs to no nation or territory, can be found on no true maps. Sometimes a well by the side of the road, or a fountain of crisp, clean water; perhaps it is the taproom of a tavern long since lost, or the gathered blood of a greatest foe, but always the same choice is given - to drink, or to walk away. This is the Well of Divinity.

Those who choose to walk away return to their mortal lives, strangely reluctant to share their experience. In time, the spark of divinity gutters out, though the heights a mortal can achieve without it are towering indeed. But the Well comes only once. Those who choose to drink are uplifted, exalted, the divine spark within them roaring into a mighty flame. But all magic comes at a price, and the cost of divinity is a steep one indeed - the sacrifice of all mortal ambition, the loss of that greatest achievement. To the mortal world, the newborn deity simply vanishes.

Over time, the newborn deity grows in power and potential, a process that can be revealed by various signs and portents visible to diviners and to those sensitive to such energies. Finally, some unknown period of time later, comes the Revelation, a vision of the new god's awakening given to those who are receptive to the deity's domain and philosophy. These become the core of the new faith's priesthood. Depending on the deity's nature, a Revelation may make its mark on the world as well, typically in the form of a general blessing, boon, or bane. The Revelation of a goddess of fire may result in charcoal and firewood burning for far longer than normal, or conversely trigger a crippling drought. Potential signs of a pending Revelation are therefore carefully examined and hotly debated.
