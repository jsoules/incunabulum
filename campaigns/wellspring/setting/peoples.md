# Peoples Of Wellspring

Wellspring is a nexus for the arcane, and draws people from not just the region but from distant lands and even other planes of existence. Demographically, Wellspring is plurality human (of various cultures and bloodlines), followed by halflings, dwarves, shoal elves, giants, and a melange of other peoples and lineages. There is also a substantial unofficial population in the Undercity.

One important thing to note is the treatment of traditional “evil” races. Goblins and kobolds are not precisely welcome, but neither are they automatically adversarial. Likewise, orcs are omitted entirely, mostly because it’s difficult to portray them without unfortunate stereotypes.

## Bloodlines

Wellspring is a nexus of magic, and that magic can manifest in the bloodlines of its people. A Bloodline is a special feat that is (usually) only available at 1st level. It typically represents the benefits of a magical heritage, such as a human with Djinni or Efreeti blood.

As a game mechanic, bloodlines largely replace hybrid lineages such as aasimar, genasi or tieflings. A player who wishes to play an aasimar can select a human with a celestial bloodline, or simply a human with unusual features and choose abilities to match the theme. Likewise, a player can choose a dwarf with an elemental heritage, or an elf with a diabolic gift.

For a partial list of available bloodlines, see [Feats]({{site.baseurl}}/systems/5e/feats#bloodlines).

## Peoples

Of the many peoples of Wellspring and the world of Myriad, only the [Peoples of Stone](#peoples-of-stone) and the [Peoples of the Dragon](#peoples-of-the-dragon) are native to this world. The [Peoples Of Bronze](#peoples-of-bronze) and the [Peoples Of Iron](#peoples-of-iron) migrated here in several great waves through the Giantish gates.

[Back To Top](#)

### Peoples Of Bronze

The peoples of Bronze came into Myriad many thousands of years ago, and include [halflings](#halflings) and the ancestors of the [elves](#elves). It is believed they migrated through the Feywild, and have close kindred still living there in the places between places.

[Back To Top](#)

### Peoples Of The Dragon

Dragons are a rare and terrifying sight, inspiring awe and dread in the lesser peoples of the world. Many mortals seek to serve, steal, or emulate that power, including [dragonborn](#dragonborn), [kobolds](#kobolds), and [mojh](#mojh).

[Back To Top](#)

### Peoples Of Iron

The peoples of Iron are the most recent migrants to the world of Myriad, including [humans](#humans), [goblins](#goblins), and [hobgoblins](#hobgoblins).

[Back To Top](#)

### Peoples Of Stone

The peoples of Stone are the original inhabitants of Myriad, and their roots stretch deep into the bones of the earth. Much of the history of the world has been shaped by the ancient conflict between the [giants](#giants) and the [dwarves](#dwarves).

[Back To Top](#)

### Other Peoples

If the origin of the [naga](#naga) is known, it is a secret closely kept. The [tortles](#tortles) are refugees from another plane, either an Elemental realm of water or a flooded part of the Feywild.

## Lineages

### Dragonborn

A dragon in need of a mortal servitor can shape an unhatched egg using magic and alchemy, transforming the child inside from a wyrmling to an approximation of the humanoid peoples. These dragonborn serve as warriors, agents, and emissaries to the dragon, and powerful dragons may have entire communities of dragonborn dedicated to their service. The change breeds true, and some dragonborn seek to leave and explore the wider world, or create a community of their own.

Dragonborn are a rare sight in human lands, even in a city as cosmopolitan as Wellspring.

[Back To Top](#)

### Dwarves

Dwarves are a common sight in Wellspring. Despite their industry and wealth, most dwarves live in the Lower City, preferring a closeness to the earth over the towers and spires above. Below the city proper is Dwarfhome, a largely (but not exclusively) Dwarven community that sits at the terminus of an underground road to Silverhold, a Dwarven city that lies somewhere under the mountains.

Dwarves’ sturdy nature makes strong bloodlines relatively rare among them. Of those, earth and metal bloodlines are particularly prized. A lineage of Dwarves with a fire bloodline, known as Azer, are native to a plane of elemental fire and sometimes seen in Wellspring; some have even chosen to settle there.

Some adventurers speak of vast underground cities of dwarves, deep beneath the earth where few surface dwellers ever venture. This underground civilization is said to be at eternal war with some great foe in the darkest depths, preventing a great catastophe from befalling the surface realms. The truth of these rumors is a mystery, but the Dwarven city of Silverhold trades for vastly more material and magic than its size would suggest, and those permitted to enter it have told of great caravans setting out for places unknown.

#### Dwarven Society

Dwarven society is very conservative and consensus-driven, and those who step outside of the boundaries are exiled from the community. The precise boundaries of what is allowed is called the Proscriptions, and can vary significantly from community to community. Most communities forbid:

- The practice of necromancy, as the reincarnation cycle of the Dwarves is sacred. Some communities take a lesser form of the Proscription, allowing for magics that rely on the bodies of the dead while eschewing those that touch upon the soul.
- The practice of infernal magic, and to a lesser extent celestial magic. Dwarven society is fiercely independent and rebukes the perceived "shackles" of both the Heavens and the Hells.
- The use of technology that poisons the land, or that consumes resources that cannot be recycled for later generations. Dwarven cities are planned to last for centuries, reshaping stone and reforging metal as needed. In particular, while dwarves use great steam engines powered by natural heat (such as volcanism), burning coal or oil is forbidden, as is the use of toxic chemicals that choke the air or seep into the land.

#### Dwarf Renunciates

Those who reject the tenets of dwarven society, or are seen has having violated the Proscriptions, are referred to as Renunciates. The so-called Dark Dwarves (touching on diabolism or necromancy) are one such group of renunciates.

### Elves

The elves of Wellspring are the descendants of the survivors of a great cataclysm, said to have befallen the elven empires of ancient times. The nature of that disaster remains a mystery to scholars - it is as if the elven empires vanished into thin air, leaving only scattered survivors far from the heart of power.

Like other lineages, elves have kin from other planes that may find their way to Wellspring. Coal elves possess a Fire bloodline and are native to plane of elemental fire. They are said to be incomparable metalworkers. Likewise, Eladrin originate from a realm of the fae, while Shadar-Kai are native to murky plane of shadows.

#### Elven Cultures

##### High Elves

High elves are rare and reclusive, the descendants of those who fled to high mountaintops. They are seen but rarely outside of their hidden cities, and are known for harboring magic and ancient secrets from before the fall of their empires. High elves disdain mixing their heritage, and rarely possess outside bloodlines.

[Back To Top](#)

##### Shoal Elves

Shoal elves are the most numerous and by far the most common of the elven groups, descendants of those who took to the seas. Lithe and gregarious, shoal elves are natural sailors, and are a particularly common sight around the Free Cities. It is said that their homeland is somewhere in the unending ocean, a hidden island refuge few outsiders ever see. Shoal elves occasionally embrace bloodlines of Wind or Water.

[Back To Top](#)

##### Wild Elves

Wild elves live in small communities far from civilization, and are likewise rare in Wellspring. Some herd wolves and reindeer in the tundra at the edge of the world; others inhabit the deserts or deep forests. Several wild elf villages are known or suspected to be in [the Bronzewood]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/geography#the-bronzewood), helping to protect that ancient forest from encroachment. Wild elves tend to favor bloodlines that match their chosen homes.

### Giants

Game Statistics
: See [Giants]({{site.baseurl}}/systems/5e/lineages#giant-traits)

Once the undisputed masters of the world, the old giants created great wonders of rune and stone, including a vast network of gates that linked far-flung places and even other planes of existence. Now, the giants live in small, isolated communities or integrated into the towns and cities of humanity.

Virtually all giants bear an [elemental bloodline]({{site.baseurl}}/systems/5e/feats#bloodlines), and tend to form communities with the like-blooded. Of these, fire and frost giants tend to keep to themselves, while stone and storm giants are more likely to visit or settle with other races. Of the giants that visit or settle with other peoples, the average height is around 7-8 feet. It is believed that giants possess a ritual to grant them much greater stature.

### Goblins

> @todo

### Halflings

Game Statistics
: See [Halflings]({{site.baseurl}}/systems/5e/lineages#halfling-traits)

After humans, halflings are the most common citizens of Wellspring; here as in many places, the two peoples find each other easy companions. Halflings are very distant cousins of the elves, and migrated with them into Myriad through the Feywild from some long-lost homeland.

#### Halfling Lineages

Nearly all halflings have an elemental bloodline, dividing them into lineages of their own.

##### Gnomes

Gnomes are halflings with an [Earth bloodline]({{site.baseurl}}/systems/5e/feats#bloodline-of-earth) or (rarely) [Metal bloodline]({{site.baseurl}}/systems/5e/feats#bloodline-of-metal). They tend to be slightly shorter and stouter, with a strong connection to the land, and are skilled craftsmen.

[Back To Top](#)

##### Sylphs

Sylphs are halflings with an [Air bloodline]({{site.baseurl}}/systems/5e/feats#bloodline-of-air) or (rarely) [Lightning bloodline]({{site.baseurl}}/systems/5e/feats#bloodline-of-lightning). They are known for their talents in illusion magic, and some have the ability to summon fairy-like wings.

[Back To Top](#)

##### Tallfolk

A lineage of halflings without an elemental heritage lives in a distant land across the sea. Known as tallfolk, it is said they rule a wide empire, although they come to Wellspring as traders and diplomats. They bring strange trinkets to trade, and seem to have a fascination with magic.

[Back To Top](#)

##### Undine

Undine are halflings with a [Water bloodline]({{site.baseurl}}/systems/5e/feats#bloodline-of-water) or (rarely) [Ice bloodline]({{site.baseurl}}/systems/5e/feats#bloodline-of-ice). They tend to be playful, with a deep love of songs and stories.

[Back To Top](#)

### Hobgoblins

> @todo

### Humans

Humans make up a plurality of the residents of Wellspring and its surroundings. Humans are a diverse lot, with a wide range of languages spoken daily as well as the common Trade tongue. Humans are visually diverse as well, ranging from the deep shades of the Sherem Magocracy to the north, to the bronze tones of the Free Cities to the west, to the pale tones of those from a distant land across the seas.

Many humans in Wellspring carry the blood of other creatures in their veins. Those with celestial, elemental, or draconic bloodlines are not common, but nor do they tend to draw unwarranted attention. Unfortunately, those who are known carry an infernal bloodline are sometimes viewed with suspicion.

#### Human Bloodlines

While bloodlines among humans are relatively rare, humans are unusually mutable to powerful magics. Some bloodlines are deliberately fostered through careful breeding with extraplanar partners, while others can emerge spontaneously from exposure to potent magical energies.

##### Aasimar

Humans with a [Celestial bloodline]({{site.baseurl}}/systems/5e/feats#celestial-bloodline) are known as aasimar. They are rarer than hen's teeth and frequently drawn to roles of leadership or public service, although an unusual number can be found among the [Watchers of the Stars]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations/watchers-of-the-stars).

[Back To Top](#)

##### Genasi

Humans with an [elemental bloodline]({{site.baseurl}}/systems/5e/feats#bloodlines) are known as genasi. Water genasi are particularly common among immigrants from the Free Cities.

[Back To Top](#)

##### Half-Elves

Humans with partial elvish ancestry are known as half-elves. Some struggle to find a place within either human or elven communities, while others (particularly in the Free Cities) find a comfortable balance where both halves of their ancestry are welcomed.

[Back To Top](#)

##### Tieflings

Humans with an [Infernal bloodline]({{site.baseurl}}/systems/5e/feats#infernal-bloodline) are known as tieflings. Many tieflings attempt to hide their heritage, either through cosmetics or illusions, while others revel in their reputation for destruction and treachery.

[Back To Top](#)

#### Human Cultures

Human culture is something of a melting pot, frequently including large numbers of halflings and smaller groups of elves, dwarves, and giants within nominally human communities.

##### The Southern Kingdoms

Wellspring (and the [Kingdom of Lothian]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/geography#the-kingdom-of-lothian)) are geographically and culturally part of the southern kingdoms, a diverse group stretching from the Sherem Magocracy to the north all the way to the southern sea. Common names in Lothian typically sound French, while Italian names are more common farther south.

[Back To Top](#)

##### The Free Cities

The [Free Cities]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/geography#the-free-cities) are a collection of independent city-states surrounding the Sea of Emeralds to the west of Lothian. They tend to have a much higher share of half-elves and water genasi. Common names in the Free Cities typically sound Greek.

[Back To Top](#)

##### The Sherem Magocracy

The [Sherem Magocracy]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/geography#the-sherem-magocracy) is a largely closed society, but scholars, wanderers, and exiles from Sherem can be found outside its borders. Sherem tend to have darker skin with extensive tattoos in silver or bronze, which glow with a faint light. Common names in Sherem resemble those from Niger-Congo.

[Back To Top](#)

##### The Northern Kingdoms

The northern kingdoms beyond the Free Cities and the Sherem Magocracy include the Kingdom of Amaranth, whose capital is justly known as Golden Amaranth for its wealth and beauty. Common names in the north typically sound English or Germanic.

[Back To Top](#)

### Kobolds

As with dragonborn, kobolds are the result of performing alchemic rituals on an unhatched dragon egg. Smaller and weaker than a dragonborn, a single egg can hatch an entire clutch of kobolds, and they are preferred as servitors by some, especially those dragons unable to perform the full rite. Kobolds hold a respect and reverence for dragonkind, but for each kobold serving a dragon there are countless more inhabiting caves, old ruins, or the less desired places of civilization.

Kobolds are not precisely welcome in most towns and cities, but nor are they an uncommon sight. Their industriousness and sorcerous gifts are sometimes welcomed by outcast communities, criminals, or those on the fringes of society.

[Back To Top](#)

### Minotaurs

Once, the minotaurs held empires to rival the giants. In the Wars of Stone between giants, minotaurs and dwarves, only the latter emerged victorious, and the minotaurs left scattered in smaller communities deep in the mountains or in deep and hidden halls of stone. In a cosmopolitan city like Wellspring, they are rare but hardly unheard of, and a minotaur guard or runesmith would be a curiousity at most.

[Back To Top](#)

### Mojh

Where dragonborn and kobolds bear gifts of draconic heritage, mojh seek to usurp it. By performing powerful magic and alchemic rites on their own bodies, they transform themselves in an attempt to transcend the limitations of their humanoid forms. In rare cases, this is done with the assistance of an assenting dragon, who adds their magic to the transformation; more commonly, this requires a dark rite using pieces of a slaughtered dragon to empower the change. It is said that the latter bear a “stench” that dragons can detect, earning the eternal enmity of dragonkind.

Mojh are very rare, even in a city like Wellspring, and tend to be solitary or to gather in communities of their own kind to study arcane mysteries.

[Back To Top](#)

### Naga

Game Statistics
: See [Naga]({{site.baseurl}}/systems/5e/lineages#naga-traits)

The serpentine naga are an unusual sight in Wellspring, the high mountain peaks being far from the hot deserts or shallow waters they prefer to call home. They are more commonly found in the jungle rivers of Sherem, or in the inland sea of the Free Cities, but naga traders or scholars are an occasional sight in Wellspring. More rarely seen are their Salamander kindred, a lineage of Naga with fire elemental bloodlines who inhabit a realm of lava and flame.
