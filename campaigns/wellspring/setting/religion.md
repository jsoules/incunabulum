## The Pantheon

The most common religion in Wellspring is polytheistic, and there are many shrines, temples, and churches to different deities. Whether or not an individual is drawn to a specific deity, they will frequently give prayers or make offerings to others in the pantheon. For example, a farmer might give his devotion to the Greenmage, but make offerings to the Storm King for good weather and to the Knight-Errant for the safety of his son, a guardsman.

### Deities Of The Pantheon

The following are only a sample of the deities in the pantheon - there are gods and goddesses from many lands, with many names. Nor is the pantheon constant. New gods emerge, arise to prominence, and then fall to obscurity as their domains and worshippers are usurped by others. No one truly know the fate of forgotten gods, and so even the most obscure sects strive to keep their faiths alive from generation to generation. It is said that in the Free City of Reval, far to the west, there is a Street of 10,000 Gods, where every deity known since the city's founding has an altar.

The Conquerer
: Patroness of battle, aggressive war, and feats of strength. She is followed by barbarians, fighters, gladiators, and a surprising number of rogues (drawn to her precept that victory is everything, no matter how it was obtained).

  *Domains:* Trickery, War.

The Forge Father
: Traditional patron of blacksmiths. Counts many dwarves among his followers, as well as warriors who rely on heavy armor for protection. Outside of dwarven communities, his worship is in decline, with many turning instead to the Iron Knight or the Mother of Machines.

  *Domains:* Forge (XGE), War.

The Greenmage
: Patron of nature, living things, and the fey. Their followers are frequently druids, rangers, or hedge mages, but they are also worshipped by farmers and hunters, as well as those in need of healing.

  *Domains:* Life, Nature.

The Knight-Errant
: Patron of protectors and honorable combat. She is followed by many fighters, monks, and paladins, who have a fierce rivalry with followers of the Conquerer.

  *Domains:* Order (TCE), War.

The Horned Warden
: Patron of nature, weather, and the cycle of seasons. Druids and rangers with a more religious bent often worship him, and hunters, farmers, and travelers give prayers and offerings.

## The Dyadic Faiths

These religions are of halfling origin, and are dualistic in nature, balanced between a benevolent protector deity and an opposing destroyer deity. Traditional practice pays reverence to the two gods in equal measure, reflecting less of a good-evil duality and more of a cycle of existence. However, most adherents of these faiths have embraced polytheism, revering their chosen patron as paramount but also paying acknowledgment to other deities at need.

### Life And Death

This faith originates from the local halfling communities, and centers around the duality of life and death. Its twin deities are only semi-personified, and its practice often includes animist veneration of elemental or nature spirits. Many elves and some humans and dwarves also follow this religion.

The Flowering
: Halfling deity of summer, nature, and the elements, associated with the [Nature arcanum]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/magic#the-nature-arcanum).

The Wilting
: Halfling deity of winter, death, and emptiness, associated with the [Death arcanum]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/magic#the-death-arcanum).

### Light And Darkness

This faith originates from a halfling community far across the sea, and centers around the duality of light and darkness. Many humans and some giants have adopted this faith as it spreads from its distant origin.

The Sun Goddess
: Halfling deity of light, life, and creation, associated with the [Sacred arcanum]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/magic#the-sacred-arcanum).

The Lord of Night
: Halfling deity of darkness and destruction, associated with the [Profane arcanum]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/magic#the-profane-arcanum).

A radical offshoot known as the [Church of Light]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations/church-of-light) is said to have all but absorbed the older faith in its land or origin, and is rapidly gaining followers here despite its intolerance of other religions, which it sees as misguided at best or demon worship at worst.

## Dwarven Deities

The traditional dwarven faith is ancient, with six chief deities, as well as a host of demigods and divine champions. Most faithful dwarves worship their gods as a whole, but feel a particular personal connection or devotion to one or two deities or demigods.

The Stonecarver
: The head of the Dwarven pantheon is the Stonecarver, who is said to have shaped the first dwarves out of the primordial earth on the first days. The Stonecarver is variably depicted as male, female, or neither. They are said to hold dominion over the natural world, from the sky to the deep earth and from the sea to the heart of a volcano. Conceptually, the Stonecarver represents the balance in all things that dwarves should strive to emulate.

The Soulkeeper
: The Soulkeeper is the dwarvish deity of the underworld and keeper of the cycle of reincarnation. He is depicted as a blindfolded dwarf holding a shield and a set of balances. No matter how high or low in society, no matter how heroic of villainous their actions, the Soulkeeper ensures their soul is returned to the Stonecarver to be forged into the next generation of dwarves.

The Greenwarden
: The Greenwarden is the dwarvish deity of birth, agriculture, and the wild. She is depicted as a dwarf holding a sickle and sheaf of grain, her beard interwoven with flowering vines. Of the dwarvish pantheon, the Greenwarden is said to care most deeply about the dwarven people, as opposed to dwarven society as a whole.

The Forgebearer
: The Forgebearer is the dwarvish deity of creativity, industry and ambition. She is depicted as a dwarf with flames for hair and beard, holding a smith's hammer. She particularly beloved of dwarves with a fire bloodline, as well as artists and those who seek to better themselves, whether selfishly or to raise up their communities.

The Runecaster
: The Runecaster is the dwarvish deity of order, magic, and law. He is depicted as a dwarf with rune-enchanted armor holding a chisel and a book. Of the dwarven deities, the Runecaster is most concerned with dwarvish society as a whole rather than the good of individuals, and his priesthood (who often double as the keepers of law) reflect this.

The Lost
: The Lost is said to be a dwarven deity who was driven mad at the dawn of time. Some tales say he or she was the first dwarf to dig up and witness the sky, while others claim that he or she found some unimaginable horror in the distant deeps. Outright worship of the Lost is forbidden even amongst most Renunciates; their places of worship destroyed and artifacts or holy texts burned. Most dwarves only know of the Lost as a cautionary figure, a warning for those who would reach beyond their grasp. Still, cults to the Lost seem to appear spontaneously.

## Other Faiths

The Convovation of Radiance
: A group of powerful beings aligned with "light", worshipped both collectively and individually. Includes some deities, powerful angels and celestials, and even past heroes or spiritual leaders, although the details vary from congregation to congregation.

  *Domains:* Life, Light, Peace (TCE).

The Elemental Lords
: This religion originated with the giants, who revere a pantheon of their own of powerful elemental spirits. At the dawn of creation, each spirit was said to grant their favor to one lineage of giants.

The Great Serpent
: This faith originates with the Naga, who believe in a powerful, sleeping deity known variously as the Great Serpent, the Great Devourer, or the World Serpent. Its awakening is said to herald the end of the world. Most who revere the Great Serpent seek to prolong its slumber, offering ritual chants and offerings of food to keep it satiated, while apocalyptic cults offer dreadful sacrifices to help it wake.
