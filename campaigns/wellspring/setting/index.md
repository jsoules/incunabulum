# Campaign Setting

A setting of renaissance urban fantasy adventure, set in a city perched on the edge of a fantastical chasm.

- [Geography](#geography)
- [Religion](#religion)

The Great Chasm of Wellspring is a natural wonder like no other. Bottomless, filled with dangers beyond imagining and riches beyond the dreams of avarice, the Chasm is an endless fountain of natural mana, saturating the earth below and the air above with raw magic. Wellspring is designed for urban adventure in a late-medieval or Renaissance fantasy style, with guilds of wizards sharing the streets with plotting merchants and clockwork servitors. It features dungeon crawls and subterranean exploration paired with urban fantasy intrigue.
