# The Curtain Rises Red

In their introductory adventure, a small theater troupe finds trouble come to them. After a mysterious emissary from the Watchers of the Stars brings a warning of danger, the party discovers a sinister force lurking beneath the theater.

## Adventure Summary

> Date: [10 Centaur]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures#spring-2258)

While preparing for a performance at the Silverstone Theater, the characters were interrupted by an acolyte from the Watchers of the Stars, a young woman named Cyrene. She warned that the stars predicted death.

On investigation, they discovered a group of thugs sneaking into the basement with a caged monster, which was accidentally set free. The monster (a Redcap) killed one of the thugs, prompting the others to flee. Two of the intruders were captured, but the leader (a female halfling) escaped into the city. Meanwhile, the murderous Redcap attempted to kill the members of the theater troupe, who managed to put it down with steel and magic.

The characters interrogated the two captured thugs, who gave their names as Lucas and Martin. They did not have any more information on the plot, but were able to cash in a favor with the mysterious Cleaner to dispose of the corpse of the third intruder. Meanwhile, Mo’s contacts at the Arcane Order allowed him to sell the body of the Redcap for a small payday.

### Characters and Organizations

[Cyrene the Astrologian]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/characters#cyrene)

: A contact of Lucas and Martin, who cashed in a favor to clean up the mess under the theater before the authorities became involved.
