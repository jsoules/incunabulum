# The Silverstone Theater Mystery

A strange magical barrier is discovered beneath the theater. Meanwhile, a librarian at the Arcane Order is asking some pointed questions about the theater's history...

## Adventure Summary

> Date: [24 Serpent]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures#summer-2258)

While tinkering in her workshop, Py noticed a strange anomaly in the theater's basement. When she and the rest of the party attempted to map out the floor plan, there was a place where the maps did not match up. On further investigation, they found a place on the exterior wall that their eyes and attention seemed to skip over.

Deciding to call in an ally, Sophie was sent to the [Watchers of the Stars]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/organizations#the-watchers-of-the-stars) with a message for the astrologian Cyrene. Using her divinations, she was able to pinpoint a powerful magical barrier protecting that area, combining abjuration to protect and an insidious enchantment that had hidden the secret from discovery. From how strongly it was integrated with the theater's structure, the magic likely dated to the construction of the building. Verity attempted to trigger the protection with a crossbow bolt, but was unable to provoke a direct response from the magic.

Stymied, the party asked Cyrene to perform an augury. The unexpected result pointed at Mo, who had a story of her own to share: apparently a librarian at the Arcane Order had been asking some pointed questions about the theater, having discovered Mo's connection to it through means unknown.

While performing this investigation, Mo also translated a rune Roya found beneath the Market District as distorted Infernal sigil for "the hunt".

With their investigation in the theater itself at a standstill, the party joined Mo and headed to the headquarters of the Arcane Order, with Mo able to use some owed favors to bring the entire group inside. Once there, Roya and Verity used their talents to avoid notice, while Py accompanied Mo as an accidental bodyguard when confronting the librarian Daragoth, a mojh who had used powerful alchemy to shape their flesh into a draconic form.

Confronted, Daragoth lead Mo and Py to their office, where they claimed to have been blackmailed into asking those questions by House Emberbloom, a house of the Harfoot Syndicate. Py quickly grew suspicious of the mojh's motives, and Verity cast a *zone of truth* over the office to enforce honesty, although Daragoth quickly counterspelled an attempt to read their thoughts directly.

While under the truth enchantment, Daragoth admitted to prior ties with the Harfoot Syndicate, including obtaining the rare draconic components necessary for their transformation. They outed House Emberbloom as responsible for the campaign of harassment against the theater; named its chief officers, leader Sindri Emberbloom and enforcer Donella Shadowcloak; and named the hookah bar called the Smoke and Mirrors as a Syndicate hangout. Daragoth claimed the Syndicate's goal was something buried beneath the theater.

Still, the party distrusted Daragoth. They declined to answer his questions, refused his help in investigation, and absolutely did not offer him sanctuary within the theater. They gave a vague promise of assistance to Daragoth, but planned to pursue other avenues of investigation.

The following day, Regent Silverstone came by the theater. The mysterious legal shenanigans threatening the theater had been exposed as fraudulent, and the Regent gave the party a bank draft for 400 gold pieces, returning the loan used to pay the theater's arrears.

While the regent was there, the party took the opportunity to discuss Vistra Silverstone and the mystery in the basement. Regent Silverstone was unaware of any enchantments or strange phenomena in the theater, and suggested they hire a consultant from the Arcane Order. The regent also commented that Vistra had spent some years in the building after her retirement, working on some grand project.

Vistra then left for the Free Cities. The only member of the Four Immortals to remain in Wellspring was Luciana Savindar. Verity remembered that Dame Savindar was hosting a benefit for the Delver's Guild that very evening.

The party's next stop was the Delver's Guild headquarters. They were greeted by Mialee Sylvaranth, a wood elf representative of the guild with whom Roya had previously interacted. She gave more information on the fundraiser - apparently, most of the guild membership was recovering from delves or from the recent monster attack. Mialee also explained the Guild's services, including the delver's insurance, the bounty board, and brokering purchases of equipment, training, and services. Flush with gold, the party agreed to join the Guild and assist with the fundraiser.

That evening, the party ventured into the Noble's Quarter for the fundraiser. Before the fundraiser began, the party met several more experienced groups from the guild: the Runewardens and the Company of the Black Lantern. In return, the characters introduced themselves for the first time as the Silverstone Players.

At the fundraiser itself, the party had to wade through gawkers from the idle rich, including a pair of useless nobles named Andri and Jacques and a very bosumy would-be sorceress named Katerine. While her attempt at an illusion cantrip was uninspiring, Katerine did hint at mysterious meetings for those interested in the "darker" aspects of magic. They did make a potentially useful contact in Falkrunn, a dwarf who was investigating trade opportunities for the Deepstone Trading Company.

Finally, the Silverstone Players had the opportunity to speak with Dame Savindar herself, who reminisced about the Four Immortals. She remembered Vistra Silverstone as the focused type, one who loved tracking down lost or forgotten magic. At the time the group disbanded, in the wake of the Sherem Wars, Silverstone was searching for a legendary Sherem artifact, one of the lost Staffs of the Magister. Since disbanding, the group has fallen out of touch; last Dame Savindar had heard, Vistra Silverstone was somewhere in the Free Cities.

Sadly for the Silverstone Players, Dame Savindar was not a fan of the theater - in her own words, she preferred to spend the time on "a good drink, a good fight, and a good tumble".

The party spent the morning discussing their options. They decided that they had two separate but related problems: first is the mystery in the basement, and second is the ongoing threat from House Emberbloom of the Harfoot Syndicate.

They decided to focus on the latter, and split their forces to try and find more information about their adversaries. Mo and Roya teamed up to check out the Smoke and Mirrors, a known hangout and front for House Emberbloom, using their respective wizardry and inborn elemental magic to invisibly investigate. Py accompanied the pair from the rooftops.

Meanwhile, Verity spoke with Lucas and Martin at their day job, namely moving crates in a warehouse in the Market District. The two were forthcoming but could only give generalities about the Syndicate. They explained that the organization was divided up into independent Houses, each of which tended to focus on one area of criminal or quasi-legitimate activity. They did offer to put Verity in touch with a contact of theirs within the Syndicate itself, an offer Verify accepted for that evening.

At the Smoke and Mirrors, Mo and Roya were successful in approaching unseen, although Py created a minor spectacle in nearly falling from the rooftops. They managed to sneak into the building through the kitchen door, observing a mostly halfling clientele along with some obvious Syndicate goons standing guard.

Daringly, Roya managed to sneak upstairs and used a rolling coin trick to distract another guard long enough to overhear a conversation between Sindri Emberbloom and his chief enforcer, Donalla Shadowcloak. Donella was of the opinion that "the wizard" had failed them, and it was time to consider alternative plans. Sindri wasn't quite ready to write the wizard off, but encouraged a contingency plan and suggested that "fire is always effective for chasing out vermin".

That evening, Verity met with Lucas, Martin, and their contact, a halfling named Marigold with a rare wood elemental bloodline. She talked openly about being part of the Harfoot Syndicate, in her case as part of House Tealeaf, which has an interest in growing things. She also gossiped freely about House Emberbloom - apparently they were new, were universally disliked, and in some financial trouble unless they could repay their loans soon. In fact, the only thing keeping them afloat was a major contract "some wizard" had hired them to perform.

Marigold capped off their meeting by offering Verity a sample of a new import she referred to as "magic beans". Apparently, they required careful preparation of fire and water, but resulted in a potent stimulant...

> [27 Serpent]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures#summer-2258)

The following morning, Py visited the alchemist Lavinia Goldfound at her shop. They discussed Py's continuing study of the alchemic arts, and Py asked her mentor to investigate the "magic beans" they had received from Marigold.

After Py rejoined the group, the party met Cyrene for lunch at the Pointed Cap. Mo explained their theory that a powerful artifact was protected in the basement of the theater; further, that the Harfoot Syndicate was after it, as was an unknown wizard. Given the party's uncertainty, Cyrene performed an augury to predict the results of the party's next steps:

"If we ask the Watchers for aid with the presumed artifact in the basement" resulted in mixed results of weal and woe, while "If we invite Daragoth to the theater" resulted in a powerful warning from the stars.

Since Cyrene's own divinations were stymied by the magical protections, she offered to ask her mentor at the Watchers of the Stars to help investigate.

That evening, Cyrene visited the theater with her mentor, an astrologian named Ngozi, who performed a powerful divination by casting gemstone dust into the air to form the shape of the constellations. Unfortunately, the protective enchantment was old and powerful, and its contents were sheltered "even from sight of the stars".

However, just as the stars are joined by the constellations, so too are mortal people and events connected. By focusing her divination, Ngozi revealed that there is a key that unlocks the enchantment, and the following clues:

- The key is a physical object.
- Three people share the same connection to the key:
  - The one who created the enchantment.
  - The one who possesses the key.
  - One among the party.
- Some among the party have seen the key before with their own eyes.
- The key is connected to Vistra Silverstone.
- The key is not a unique object.
- The key is both earned and stolen.
- The one who holds the key knows its nature and its purpose.

From these clues, the party deduced that the key is the old Arcane Order emblem of Vistra Silverstone, and that they had seen the key on the wall of Daragoth's office in the Arcane Order.

With that, the party resolved to break into Daragoth's office and steal the key. While investigating, Mo found that the room directly above the office was a humble broom closet. Unfortunately, it was devoid of any convenient pipes or ways to fake a plumbing leak, and Mo recalled that the Arcane Order's library (of which Daragoth's office appeared to be a purloined closet) was magically protected against fires or spills.

Even more unfortunately, Daragoth themself cornered Mo as the latter tried to leave. In her panic, Mo revealed several details to the mojh, including that the party had found a powerful protective enchantment in their basement.

It seemed like the situation was rapidly becoming critical, and the party discussed their options late into the night. Mo, Py, and Roya stayed in the theater overnight, while Verity went home for a well-deserved rest.

The following morning, as Verity was returning to the theater, Py noticed a large group of ne'er-do-wells converging. Fortunately, a shouted warning allowed Verity to reach the theater without an issue. Sensing a confrontation, the Silverstone Players moved to guard the building, with Py and her steel defender protecting the back entrances while the rest of the party guarded the front. Mo sent Sophie with a note to the city guard, while Roya and Verity shouted threats at the gathering thugs from the windows.

Unexpectedly, the next move was a knock on the front doors. Sindri Emberbloom himself, along with his chief enforcer Donella Shadowcloak, arrived to request a parley, or in his words "a civilized conversation". Although reluctant, the party allowed Sindri alone inside to talk.

Sindri opened by claiming it was time that he and the Silverstone Players had a chat. Specifically, that he had underestimated them, thinking them unwitting obstacles rather than full players in the game. In particular, he had seen Py scouting the rooftops near the Smoke and Mirrors, although he seemed unaware that Mo and Roya had managed to sneak inside. He also stated a belief that the party had made their own arrangement with Daragoth the Mojh. Sindri proposed an alternative resolution - allow him to remove the treasure and there would be no further problems from the Syndicate.

He allowed Verity to cast a *zone of truth*, and confirmed that Daragoth was the one to hire House Emberbloom in the first place. In turn, the party revealed that they themselves did not have an arrangement with Daragoth, nor did they know for certain what was in the basement of the theater. However, they were unwilling to allow Sindri and his goons to search the theater for the alleged treasure, partly because they knew the treasure could only be safely removed with the key, still in Daragoth's possession.

The impasse was broken when Donella Shadowcloak demanded entry as well, and passed a message to Sindri that the team sent to take care of "the wizard" had failed, and that (thanks to Mo's earlier warning) the city guard were now approaching the square. With that, Sindri and the rest of House Emberbloom withdrew.

With the Syndicate gone, the party put their heads together and decided their immediate need to was to get the key from Daragoth. They set out together toward the Arcane Order's headquarters, but ran into a running battle in the streets of Wellspring between Daragoth and House Emberbloom. The mojh had somehow conjured a trio of fearsome guard drakes, while Sindri Emberbloom called forth fire snakes that melted their way out of the pavement to supplement his mundane forces.

Seeing their enemies distracted, the party split up, with Roya and Py staying behind to watch the battle while Mo and Verity went ahead to the Arcane Order. The battle continued until the guards came in force.

Mo and Verity arrived at the Arcane Order ahead of Daragoth, using Mo's spell of invisibility and Verity cleverly hiding in plain sight to avoid their notice. Mo used this to sneak inside Daragoth's office when they arrived, watching them take the worn Arcane Order emblem off the wall as well as hastily grabbing some potions and scrolls before repeating their personal sigil to unlock the elaborate tome chained to their desk and disappearing into it.

Mo then let the remaining party members into the room, and a quick search revealed a basic potion of healing as well as a pair of arcane scrolls. They then pursued the mojh into the book, revealing a dimensional space holding a mansion surrounded by roiling purple mists.

Inside the mansion, they followed footprints in the dust upstairs, where they were briefly stalled by an animate suit of armor. Between Py and Roya, the armor was quickly disassembled. They continued on through a storeroom and into an observatory enspelled to look like a grassy hill beneath the night sky. In the center of a ring of telescopes stood Daragoth the Mojh, who had just finished transforming a pile of draconic parts into a live Guard Drake.

Daragoth "magnanimously" offered to answer questions before killing the party. The mojh was grandiose and paranoid, craving power and recognition but believing themselves persecuted by academic rivals. They believed that finding the Staff of the Magister beneath the theater was their opportunity, and hired House Emberbloom as cat's paws to drive out the theater company without drawing notice to themself.

As Daragoth prepared to attack, Roya struck from invisibility and landed the first blow. Mo follows up with a trio of pinpoint scorching rays. Daragoth retaliates with a devastating fireball, nearly bringing Py and Verity to their knees.

Mo casts a suggestion that the guard drake will turn on Daragoth; unfortunately this backfires as Daragoth looses a bolt of lightning that also courses through Py. Daragoth continues throwing multiple cantrips at a time against Roya, Py, and his own guard drake. Between Roya's arrows and Py's wrench the guard drake is brought down. One more volley of magic missiles from Mo, and Daragoth also fell.

However, in the party's moment of victory, Daragoth revealed his trap - the dimensional mansion would seal forever when he breathes his last breath. The party took his shoulderbag, still with Vistra Silverstone's emblem inside it (along with several more potions and scrolls), and attempted to tie them up while stabilising them. However, the pocket mansion continued to destabilize. Mo unlocked the front doors with Daragoth's sigil, showing a hazy reflection of Daragoth's office, and the party fled through.

As they escaped, the book was spewing multicolored sparks and finally exploded in arcs of arcane energy. After a careful examination, Mo determined that the book was damaged by Daragoth's tinkering but that with some rare materials and enchanting expertise, it could be repaired.

From there, the party discussed the fate of the comatose Daragoth, with suggestions including simply killing them and turning them over to House Emberbloom. Py advocated for killing them immediately, while Verity favored leaving them unconscious in the streets. Py and Roya each dealt a potentially lethal blow, taking the damaged book and leaving the body in their office.

From there, the party returns to the theater, where they are drawn by the key down into the basement. They took some time to rest before investigating. Touching the wall reveals a narrow staircase leading downward perhaps fifty feet, revealing Vistra Silverstone's hidden workshop. They find a note from Vistra Silverstone to "Luciana, Riordan and Ulmo", stating that she'd found one of the three items she was looking for.

Inside a chest beside the desk, the party found a long piece of fine cloth, a foot wide by twenty long, covered in Sherem writing. They also found several sketches of a broken staff, suggesting that the cloth was the wrapping for a staff. Roya also discovered another mechanism that closed off a passage deeper beneath the city. The party left the damaged dimensional book in the workshop and resealed the staircase using the key.
