## Adventure Summary

> Date: [24 Serpent]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures#spring-2258)

While tinkering in her workshop, Py noticed a strange anomaly in the theater's basement. When she and the rest of the party attempted to map out the floor plan, there was a place where the maps did not match up. On further investigation, they found a place on the exterior wall that their eyes and attention seemed to skip over.

Deciding to call in an ally, Sophie was sent to the [Watchers of the Stars]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/organizations#the-watchers-of-the-stars) with a message for the astrologian Cyrene. Using her divinations, she was able to pinpoint a powerful magical barrier protecting that area, combining abjuration to protect and an insidious enchantment that had hidden the secret from discovery. From how strongly it was integrated with the theater's structure, the magic likely dated to the construction of the building. Verity attempted to trigger the protection with a crossbow bolt, but was unable to provoke a direct response from the magic.

Stymied, the party asked Cyrene to perform an augury. The unexpected result pointed at Mo, who had a story of her own to share: apparently a librarian at the Arcane Order had been asking some pointed questions about the theater, having discovered Mo's connection to it through means unknown.

With their investigation in the theater itself at a standstill, the party joined Mo and headed to the headquarters of the Arcane Order, with Mo able to use some owed favors to bring the entire group inside. Once there, Roya and Verity used their talents to avoid notice, while Py accompanied Mo as an accidental bodyguard when confronting the librarian Daragoth, a mojh who had used powerful alchemy to shape their flesh into a draconic form.

Confronted, Daragoth lead Mo and Py to their office, where they claimed to have been blackmailed into asking those questions by House Emberbloom, a house of the Harfoot Syndicate. Py quickly grew suspicious of the mojh's motives, and Verity cast a *zone of truth* over the office to enforce honesty, although Daragoth quickly counterspelled an attempt to read their thoughts directly.

While under the truth enchantment, Daragoth admitted to prior ties with the Harfoot Syndicate, including obtaining the rare draconic components necessary for their transformation. They outed House Emberbloom as responsible for the campaign of harassment against the theater; named its chief officers, leader Sindri Emberbloom and enforcer Donella Shadowcloak; and named the hookah bar called the Smoke and Mirrors as a Syndicate hangout. Daragoth claimed the Syndicate's goal was something buried beneath the theater.

Still, the party distrusted Daragoth. They declined to answer his questions, refused his help in investigation, and absolutely did not offer him sanctuary within the theater. They gave a vague promise of assistance to Daragoth, but planned to pursue other avenues of investigation.
