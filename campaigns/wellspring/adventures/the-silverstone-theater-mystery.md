# The Silverstone Theater Mystery

A strange magical barrier is discovered beneath the theater. Meanwhile, a librarian at the Arcane Order is asking some pointed questions about the theater's history...

## Adventure Summary

> Date: [24 Serpent]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures#spring-2258)

While tinkering in her workshop, Py noticed a strange anomaly in the theater's basement. When she and the rest of the party attempted to map out the floor plan, there was a place where the maps did not match up. On further investigation, they found a place on the exterior wall that their eyes and attention seemed to skip over.

Deciding to call in an ally, Sophie was sent to the [Watchers of the Stars]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/organizations#the-watchers-of-the-stars) with a message for the astrologian Cyrene. Using her divinations, she was able to pinpoint a powerful magical barrier protecting that area, combining abjuration to protect and an insidious enchantment that had hidden the secret from discovery. From how strongly it was integrated with the theater's structure, the magic likely dated to the construction of the building. Verity attempted to trigger the protection with a crossbow bolt, but was unable to provoke a direct response from the magic.

Stymied, the party asked Cyrene to perform an augury. The unexpected result pointed at Mo, who had a story of her own to share: apparently a librarian at the Arcane Order had been asking some pointed questions about the theater, having discovered Mo's connection to it through means unknown.

While performing this investigation, Mo also translated a rune Roya found beneath the Market District as distorted Infernal sigil for "the hunt".

With their investigation in the theater itself at a standstill, the party joined Mo and headed to the headquarters of the Arcane Order, with Mo able to use some owed favors to bring the entire group inside. Once there, Roya and Verity used their talents to avoid notice, while Py accompanied Mo as an accidental bodyguard when confronting the librarian Daragoth, a mojh who had used powerful alchemy to shape their flesh into a draconic form.

Confronted, Daragoth lead Mo and Py to their office, where they claimed to have been blackmailed into asking those questions by House Emberbloom, a house of the Harfoot Syndicate. Py quickly grew suspicious of the mojh's motives, and Verity cast a *zone of truth* over the office to enforce honesty, although Daragoth quickly counterspelled an attempt to read their thoughts directly.

While under the truth enchantment, Daragoth admitted to prior ties with the Harfoot Syndicate, including obtaining the rare draconic components necessary for their transformation. They outed House Emberbloom as responsible for the campaign of harassment against the theater; named its chief officers, leader Sindri Emberbloom and enforcer Donella Shadowcloak; and named the hookah bar called the Smoke and Mirrors as a Syndicate hangout. Daragoth claimed the Syndicate's goal was something buried beneath the theater.

Still, the party distrusted Daragoth. They declined to answer his questions, refused his help in investigation, and absolutely did not offer him sanctuary within the theater. They gave a vague promise of assistance to Daragoth, but planned to pursue other avenues of investigation.

The following day, Regent Silverstone came by the theater. The mysterious legal shenanigans threatening the theater had been exposed as fraudulent, and the Regent gave the party a bank draft for 400 gold pieces, returning the loan used to pay the theater's arrears.

While the regent was there, the party took the opportunity to discuss Vistra Silverstone and the mystery in the basement. Regent Silverstone was unaware of any enchantments or strange phenomena in the theater, and suggested they hire a consultant from the Arcane Order. The regent also commented that Vistra had spent some years in the building after her retirement, working on some grand project.

Vistra then left for the Free Cities. The only member of the Four Immortals to remain in Wellspring was Luciana Savindar. Verity remembered that Dame Savindar was hosting a benefit for the Delver's Guild that very evening.

The party's next stop was the Delver's Guild headquarters. They were greeted by Mialee Sylvaranth, a wood elf representative of the guild with whom Roya had previously interacted. She gave more information on the fundraiser - apparently, most of the guild membership was recovering from delves or from the recent monster attack. Mialee also explained the Guild's services, including the delver's insurance, the bounty board, and brokering purchases of equipment, training, and services. Flush with gold, the party agreed to join the Guild and assist with the fundraiser.

That evening, the party ventured into the Noble's Quarter for the fundraiser. Before the fundraiser began, the party met several more experienced groups from the guild: the Runewardens and the Company of the Black Lantern. In return, the characters introduced themselves for the first time as the Silverstone Players.

At the fundraiser itself, the party had to wade through gawkers from the idle rich, including a pair of useless nobles named Andri and Jacques and a very bosumy would-be sorceress named Katerine. While her attempt at an illusion cantrip was uninspiring, Katerine did hint at mysterious meetings for those interested in the "darker" aspects of magic. They did make a potentially useful contact in Falkrunn, a dwarf who was investigating trade opportunities for the Deepstone Trading Company.

Finally, the Silverstone Players had the opportunity to speak with Dame Savindar herself, who reminisced about the Four Immortals. She remembered Vistra Silverstone as the focused type, one who loved tracking down lost or forgotten magic. At the time the group disbanded, in the wake of the Sherem Wars, Silverstone was searching for a legendary Sherem artifact, one of the lost Staffs of the Magister. Since disbanding, the group has fallen out of touch; last Dame Savindar had heard, Vistra Silverstone was somewhere in the Free Cities.

Sadly for the Silverstone Players, Dame Savindar was not a fan of the theater - in her own words, she preferred to spend the time on "a good drink, a good fight, and a good tumble".
