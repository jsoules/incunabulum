# Adventures

[The Curtain Rises Red](./the-curtain-rises-red)
: In their introductory adventure, a small theater troupe finds trouble come to them. After a mysterious emissary from the Watchers of the Stars brings a warning of danger, the party discovers a sinister force lurking beneath the theater.

[A Volatile Tail](./a-volatile-tail)
: More machinations endanger the theater, forcing the party to quickly raise funds to save it. They are hired by a shady alchemist to recover a stolen batch of alchemist's fire from beneath the city. After traipsing through the sewers and battling a nest of ever-hungry ratlings, they return to the surface in triumph, only to discover themselves mid-Upwelling and fighting off a swarm of deadly beasts.
