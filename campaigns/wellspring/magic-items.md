# Magic Items

A successful adventure brings many rewards, including experience, gold, works of art, reputation and social contacts. And, most importantly, magic items. In Wellspring, there are two main ways that characters can earn magic items: as direct rewards from an adventure, and by exchanging [Magicite crystals]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/magic#magicite-crystals).

Direct rewards are straightforward - the party discovers an advanced Potion of Healing on a shelf, or a Pearl of Power glimmering in the kuo-toa's spawning pond. Magic items discovered during an adventure are available immediately; they can be allocated to characters based on need, or held onto for safe-keeping and later sale or trade.

In contrast, trading magicite for enchanted items gives the character much more flexibility in finding an item that meets their needs. However, this process takes time. Specifically, exchanging magicite for a magic item is a Downtime activity that takes place between adventures.

## Classifying Magic Items

Magic items can be divided up based on two criteria:

- The magic item's *rarity*, which can range from Common to Legendary.
- Whether the item is a *minor* or a *major* magic item.

Additionally, many magic items require *attunement*, which limits the number of such items a character can use.

### Item Rarity

Each magic item has a *rarity*. In ascending order, these are Common, Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare, and Legendary. (Artifacts are beyond the scope of these rules). As the item's rarity goes up, so does it's level of power, its gold value, and the difficulty of acquiring it.

In the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, *Xanathar's Guide To Everything*, or *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*, the rarity of each magic item is listed in the entry for that item.

### Minor And Major Items

Magic items are also divided into *minor* and *major* items. Minor items are often limited-use items such as potions or scrolls, or items with smaller or ancillary effects. Major items tend to have powerful and long-lasting benefits, such as magical weapons or armor. Generally speaking, even for items of the same rarity, minor items will be much easier to find and acquire.

In the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, minor items are listed on Magic Item Tables A through E, while major items are on tables F through I.

All of the Common items listed in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything* are minor items.

In *Tasha's Cauldon of Everything*, all of the magic tattoos and the Prosthetic Limb item are minor items. All of the other non-artifact items listed are major items.

## Exchanging Magicite

In Wellspring, recovered magicite can be exchanged for magic items, either by trading for an existing item or commissioning a new or custom item for the character. Both of these options take time to complete, and take place during a Downtime.

Nearly all trades of magicite are done through one of Wellspring's major [organizations]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/organizations), who have the resources and clout to organize and broker such exchanges.

- The [Delver's Guild]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/organizations#the-delvers-guild) offers a number of services to its members, including appraisal of magicite and serving as a broker for buying, selling, and trading magic items. The guild's social clout (not to mention its veritable army of affiliated adventurers) makes it a trusted partner that few in Wellspring are willing to cross.
- The crafting of enchanted items with magicite is a secret closely held by the [Arcane Order]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/organizations#the-arcane-order), and most trades not affiliated with the Delver's Guild are handled there.
- Items that are illegal, distasteful, or particularly rare may be found on the black market, which is for the most part run by the [Harfoot Syndicate]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/organizations#the-harfoot-syndicate).
- Certain specialty items may be found at some of the other or smaller organizations. For example, items related to astrology or divination may be found through the Watchers of the Stars, while those related to planar travel might be brokered through the Brotherhood of Planar Cartographers.
