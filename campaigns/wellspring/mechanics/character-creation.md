# Character Creation

Wellspring uses some custom, optional rules for creating characters.

- [Creating A Character](#creating-a-character)
- [Lineages](#lineages)
- [Ability Scores](#ability-scores)
- [Backgrounds](#backgrounds)
- [Equipment](#equipment)

## Creating A Character

At the beginning of the campaign, characters will begin at 2nd level. To create a new character, perform the following steps:

1. Choose a [Lineage](#lineages). For a list of recommended lineages, see [Peoples of Wellspring]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/peoples).
2. Choose a Class. The [Character Classes]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/mechanics/character-classes) guide has more information on how different classes may fit into Wellspring.
3. Determine [Ability Scores](#ability-scores), using either the standard array or the point buy method. Use the ability score bonuses listed in that link instead of any bonuses from your lineage. Your character may also gain additional ability scores from feats.
4. Choose a [Background](#backgrounds).
5. Choose your Feats. All characters gain a feat at 1st level from your Background. You may also gain a feat from your lineage. You can choose feats from the *Player's Handbook*, *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*, *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*, or other published sources with the DM's approval, or from the [following feats]({{site.baseurl}}/systems/5e/feats), which include [Bloodlines and Talents](#bloodlines-and-talents).
5. Choose your Proficiencies.
    1. Your character gains *skill* and *tool* proficiencies from your class and from your background, and may gain additional proficiencies from your lineage.
    2. Your character gains *weapon*, *armor*, and *saving throw* proficiencies from your class.
    3. Your character gains one free *language* proficiency, as well as one additional language from your background, and may gain additional proficiencies from your lineage.
6. Choose your [equipment](#equipment). Your character gains the listed equipment for your class, plus 50 gp of additional funds from your background.
    1. In lieu of the background funds, you may choose to instead gain basic membership in one of Wellspring's [organizations]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/organizations), such as the Arcane Order or the Delver's Guild.
    2. If you do not wish to use some of the equipment granted by your class, you can instead choose to take half of that item's cost in gold pieces as starting funds.

## Lineages

The word *Lineage* is used over the historical "Race" as a more neutral option for referring to a character's ancestry. When selecting a lineage, players gain all of the specified benefits of that lineage **except** for the Ability Score Increase, if any. See [Backgrounds And Ability Scores](#backgrounds-and-ability-scores), above.

For a list of recommended lineages, see [Peoples of Wellspring]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/peoples). This is not an exhaustive list; if you wish to play a character with a different origin, feel free to ask the DM.

### Bloodlines

Wellspring is a nexus of magic, and that magic can manifest in the bloodlines of its people. A Bloodline is a special feat that is (usually) only available at 1st level. Despite the name, a Bloodline does not have to represent a heritable ability; for example, a Bloodline of Fire feat could represent an ancestor's dalliance with a fiery efreeti, a parent who is a famed fire sorcerer, or the result of a laboratory accident involving transmutagenic potions and an unexpected Fire Newt.

As players gain levels, they may choose to spend later feats on improving their bloodline abilities, if any.

## Ability Scores

When creating a character, players should use either the standard array of scores (see *Player's Handbook*, page 13) or the point buy method described under Variant: Customizing Ability Scores.

- The standard array: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8
- The point buy method: Spend 27 points based on the following table.

  | **Score** | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
  | **Cost**  | 0 | 1 | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 7  | 9  |

### Lineages And Ability Scores

Instead of applying the ability score bonus listed for your lineage (see [Lineages](#lineages), below), choose one of the following options at character creation:

- Increase one ability score by +2, and a second ability score by +1.
- Increase three ability scores by +1 each.

### Backgrounds And Ability Scores

[Backgrounds](#backgrounds) do not improve ability scores directly; however, as part of choosing your background you have the option to choose a Feat, which may improve one of your ability scores. You should keep that in mind when selecting your base scores.

## Backgrounds

The people of Wellspring come from diverse backgrounds, and those that turn to adventure have a wide range of talents as they begin their journeys. Instead of choosing a standard background, determine the benefits from character's background as follows:

Skill Proficiencies
: Choose two Skills. Your character gains Proficiency in them.

Tool Proficiency
: Choose one tool. Your character gains Proficiency with it.

Language
: Your character knows one additional language.

Feat
: Choose one 1st-level Feat. Your character gains that Feat. This can include a [Bloodline](#bloodlines) feat or a Talent.

Equipment
: Your character gains 50 GP to spend on starting equipment. The character keeps any unspent GP as spare coin.

### Bloodlines And Talents

Bloodlines and Talents are special feats that provide additional bonuses compared to a regular feat. However, they come with certain restrictions:

- Bloodlines and Talents can only be selected at 1st level without DM approval.
- Each character can have at most one Bloodline or Talent, even if they can select more than one feat at 1st level.
  - The one exception to the above rule is that characters with a Bloodline *granted by their Lineage*, such as Giants, may also have a Talent.

## Equipment

Characters can choose from the standard equipment listed in the *Player's Handbook*. In addition, consumable items such as potions and scrolls are readily available, as per the following:

### Potions For Sale

| **Potions** | **Cost** |
| *Healing* | 50 gp |
| *Climbing* | 75 gp |
| *Animal Friendship* | 100 gp |
| *Greater Healing* | 100 gp |
| *Water Breathing* | 100 gp |

### Spell Scrolls For Sale
