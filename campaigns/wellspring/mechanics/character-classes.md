# Character Classes

The character classes in the *Player's Handbook* (and the Artificer class in *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*) are each presented as having a role or place in the game world. A cleric is a holy warrior with powerful divine magic, a barbarian is an outlander with battle rage, and so on. These roles are absolutely valid, and if they match your character concept, please feel free to embrace them. But these roles are only a starting point - they are not the only way a character of these classes can be played.

Want to play a cleric who is a scholarly mystic who studies the divine? Go for it. Want to play a barbarian who is an alchemist with a serum out of Jekyll and Hyde? No problem. You should probably come prepared with *some* reason why your character's abilities match the concept, but beyond that the sky is the limit.

You can also use the rules for [Customizing Class Proficiencies]({{site.baseurl}}/systems/5e/classes#proficiencies).

### Artificer

*Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*

Artificers are drawn to Wellspring for three reasons - mana, patronage, or adventure. Wellspring's location atop the Great Chasm and its limitless flow of raw mana is an invaluable resource for artificers relying on magical enchantments to power their creations. That flow of mana is matched by a flow of money; the wealthy of Wellspring command considerable resources, and an artifier seeking a patron for their work may find a receptive audience. Finally, for the more independent-minded the vast labyrinth beneath the city provides a lucrative, if dangerous, opportunity to earn funds for further experiments.

A few artificers rely less on magical enhancement for their creations and more on cleverly designed mechanics, creating clockwork toys or even powerful mechanical constructs. This style is rare in Wellspring, although the Free City of Gerlon to the west is known for innovation in engineering and natural philosophy.

Magically-inclined artificers often join the [Arcane Order]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-arcane-order), while those more focused on commerce are members of the [Merchantry Association]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-merchantry-association).

#### Runethanes

A unique option for the Wellspring campaign is the [Runethane]({{site.baseurl}}/systems/5e/classes/#runethane) class. Rather than combining magic and technology, runethanes create their effects by inscribing or carving runes.

#### Character Roles

- **Armored:** A strong character relying on heavy armor and defenses for protection. Other classes for this role: Cleric, Fighter, Paladin.
- **Crafter:** A character focused on creating and using equipment to become stronger. Other classes for this role: Cleric (Forge Domain).
- **Utility:** A character with a range of abilities rather than focusing on one. Other classes for this role: Bard, Rogue, Wizard.

### Barbarian

Despite the stereotype of the outlander from the wilderness, Barbarians can be equally at home in Wellspring as in the distant wilds. Although described as a "rage", the barbarian's characteristic ability can take many forms. Giantist tradition describe it as a battle lust, while dwarven berserkers rely on an alchemical concoction to trigger a physical and mental transformation. Barbarians are particularly prized fighters in the underground sparring pits, but are equally valued among delvers when venturing beneath the depths of the city.

#### Character Roles

- **Brute:** A character who hits hard and holds territory. Other classes for this role: Druid (in Wild Shape), Fighter, Ranger, Paladin.
- **Skirmisher:** A fast-moving character who controls the battlefield. Other classes for this role: Monk, Ranger, Rogue.

### Bard

The Bard as a practice mixing music and magic originated with Halflings, and their people have a rich tradition of music and storytelling. Among humans, the folk tradition has grown to encompass everything from common gleemen to formal court bards. The giants have a parallel tradition of war skalds, keeping an oral tradition of great heroes and greater battles. The dwarves employ war chanters, who keep the long lineages of their clans and cities.

In Wellspring, bards can be found among street performers as much as in the halls of the rich and powerful. A few join the [Arcane Order]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-arcane-order), but most find their study and regimentation stifling. Bards are also common among the [Harfoot Syndicate]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-harfoot-syndicate).

#### Character Roles

- **Diplomat:** A character who uses social skills to stand out. Other classes for this role: Rogue, Sorcerer.
- **Support:** A character who enhances the rest of the group. Other classes for this role: Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Wizard.
- **Utility:** A character with a range of abilities rather than focusing on one. Other classes for this role: Bard, Rogue, Wizard.

### Cleric

Not all priests or priestesses are Clerics, and not all Clerics are tied to a religious organization or even to a deity. The core element of a Cleric is *faith*. Usually, a cleric believes so strongly in something that magic itself responds - whether in a religion or a deity, a principle, or even a cause. In some cases, however, the connection is reversed. Such clerics find themselves bound to something they may not entirely understand.

Clerics in Wellspring bring their devotion to all that they do, whether it is as part of an organization or as a lone devotee of a cause only they can see. Those of a more scholarly bent may join the [Arcane Order]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-arcane-order), while clerics with a more mystical bent may join the [Watchers of the Stars]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-watchers-of-the-stars). Clerics with healing ability are also prized by the [Delver's Guild]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-delvers-guild) and the [City Guard]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-city-guard).

Clerics in Wellspring can select the [Cloistered Cleric]({{site.baseurl}}/systems/5e/classes/#cloistered-cleric) class variant.

#### Character Roles

- **Armored:** A strong character relying on heavy armor and defenses for protection. Other classes for this role: Artificer, Fighter, Paladin.
- **Crafter:** A character focused on creating and using equipment to become stronger. Other classes for this role: Artificer.
- **Utility:** A character with a range of abilities rather than focusing on one. Other classes for this role: Bard, Rogue, Wizard.

### Druid

At first glance, Druids may be an odd choice for an urban adventure campaign, but druids can have a strong role even in Wellspring. Druids with the traditional connection to nature have a place in Wellspring, whether as part of the druidic circles in the Bronzewood outside the city or by connecting with the diverse and magically distinct ecosystems beneath the city. Other druids are more scholarly, studying nature magic and its connections. Rather than nature, some druids attribute their powers to elemental spirits.

Druids in Wellspring may join the [Watchers of the Stars]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-watchers-of-the-stars), particularly those who study or venerate the stars. Those of a more scholarly bent may join the [Arcane Order]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-arcane-order).

#### Character Roles

- **Brute:** A character who hits hard and holds territory. Other classes for this role: Barbarian, Fighter, Ranger, Paladin.
- **Support:** A character who enhances the rest of the group. Other classes for this role: Bard, Druid, Paladin, Wizard.

### Fighter

One of the most versatile classes, Fighters rely first and foremost on their martial prowess. In Wellspring, that prowess is particularly valued, both in expeditions beneath the city and when mana surges drive monsters into Wellspring itself. Fighters run the gamut from spell duelists and noble guards in the Upper City to pit brawlers and criminal enforcers in the Undercity.

In Wellspring the [City Guard]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-city-guard) and [Stonewardens]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-stonewardens) actively recruit fighters, as does the [Harfoot Syndicate]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-harfoot-syndicate). Eldritch Knights will sometimes join the [Arcane Order]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-arcane-order), while Psi Warriors are sometimes drawn to the elusive [Society of the Third Eye]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-society-of-the-third-eye).

#### Character Roles

- **Armored:** A strong character relying on heavy armor and defenses for protection. Other classes for this role: Artificer, Cleric, Paladin.
- **Brute:** A character who hits hard and holds territory. Other classes for this role: Barbarian, Druid, Ranger, Paladin.

### Monk

The Monk class can be taken in a few different directions. Some focus more on martial prowess, in effect being more akin to Fighters with a specialized skill set, and with a similar role in Wellspring society. Others focus more on mysticism, and fill a role similar to Clerics or Druids, depending on their respective belief systems. Still other Monks belong to existing orders or organizations that provide support and guidance.

In Wellspring, the most prominent monastic order is the [Falling Stars]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-falling-stars), the protectors of the [Watchers of the Stars]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-watchers-of-the-stars). Most Falling Stars are Monks with the Way of the Astral Self subclass. Monks of the Way of the Four Elements may join the [Arcane Order]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-arcane-order), while Monks of the Way of Shadow are greatly valued by the [Harfoot Syndicate]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-harfoot-syndicate). Elven Monks often choose the Way of the Kensei, while a notable order of Dwarven Monks follows the Way of the Drunken Master.

#### Character Roles

- **Controller:** A character who disrupts enemies and weakens them for their allies. Other classes for this role: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard.
- **Skirmisher:** A fast-moving character who controls the battlefield. Other classes for this role: Barbarian, Ranger, Rogue.

### Paladin

While the name Paladin evokes a holy knight, this is only one of many roles that members of this class can fulfill. A more inclusive name might be Champion, as most Paladins draw their powers from a powerful oath. Accordingly, a Paladin's role in society may depend strongly on their sworn oath and how it shapes their goals and methods.

In Wellspring, Paladins who swore an Oath of Glory are often drawn to the [Delver's Guild]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-delvers-guild) and the promise of adventure beneath the city. Those who have sworn the Oath of Devotion often fall into the traditional holy knight role, either championing individual causes or serving a larger martial or religious organization.

#### Character Roles

- **Armored:** A strong character relying on heavy armor and defenses for protection. Other classes for this role: Artificer, Cleric, Fighter.
- **Brute:** A character who hits hard and holds territory. Other classes for this role: Barbarian, Fighter, Druid (in Wild Shape), Ranger.
- **Support:** A character who enhances the rest of the group. Other classes for this role: Bard, Cleric, Druid, Wizard.

### Ranger

As with Druids, Rangers may seem an odd fit for a heavily urban area. However, their skills of monster hunting, tracking, and navigating hostile environments can be of tremendous value in the streets as well as in the wilds, and skilled Rangers with urban experience can find lucrative work as private investigators or bounty hunters. Conversely, Rangers with traditional skills are highly valued for expeditions below the city, where navigating the correct path may mean the difference between a safe return and a gruesome demise.

In Wellspring, Rangers are actively recruited by the [City Guard]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-city-guard) and the [Delver's Guild]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-delvers-guild), while those of a criminal bent may turn to the [Harfoot Syndicate]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-harfoot-syndicate). Horizon Walkers are particularly prized by both the [Arcane Order]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-arcane-order) and the [Planar Cartographers]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-planar-cartographers).

#### Character Roles

- **Brute:** A character who hits hard and holds territory. Other classes for this role: Barbarian, Druid (in Wild Shape), Fighter, Paladin.
- **Skirmisher:** A fast-moving character who controls the battlefield. Other classes for this role: Barbarian, Monk, Rogue.

### Rogue

The quintessential class for urban adventure, Rogues combine a wide range of useful skills with versatile combat prowess. From fancy Upper City swashbucklers to Undercity cutpurses, Rogues can be found in every part of Wellspring. Despite the stereotype of Rogues as thieves and cutthroats, Rogues can also be honorable warriors, charming performers, or cunning investigators.

In Wellspring, the [Harfoot Syndicate]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-harfoot-syndicate) actively recruits rogues of all types, but Thieves, Masterminds and Assassins are particularly valued. Arcane Tricksters may join the [Arcane Order]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-arcane-order). Swashbucklers are welcome in the [City Guard]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-city-guard), and can be hired as guards for the noble houses in the Upper City. Scouts are in great demand from the [Delver's Guild]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-delvers-guild), and the rare Soulknives are welcomed by the [Society of the Third Eye]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-society-of-the-third-eye).

#### Character Roles

- **Diplomat:** A character who uses social skills to stand out. Other classes for this role: Bard, Sorcerer.
- **Skirmisher:** A fast-moving character who controls the battlefield. Other classes for this role: Barbarian, Monk, Ranger.
- **Utility:** A character with a range of abilities rather than focusing on one. Other classes for this role: Artificer, Bard, Wizard.

### Sorcerer

The city of Wellspring overflows with magic, and that magic can take root in the blood of its people. For many, this manifests as a [Bloodline]({{site.baseurl}}/systems/5e/feats#bloodlines), but in others it grants them a powerful form of magic. Other Sorcerers draw their magic from a connection to an external source of power, while a few gain their abilities through scholarship and study, albeit a very individual process compared to that of a wizard.

In Wellspring, sorcerers are most often drawn to the [Arcane Order]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-arcane-order).

#### Character Roles

- **Blaster:** A character who dishes out the hurt at range and against multiple foes. Other classes for this role: Warlock, Wizard.
- **Controller:** A character who disrupts enemies and weakens them for their allies. Other classes for this role: Monk, Warlock, Wizard.
- **Diplomat:** A character who uses social skills to stand out. Other classes for this role: Bard, Rogue.

### Warlock

Enigmatic and powerful, most Warlocks are defined by their connection to a magical patron. For some, their power instead reflects the gifts of their heritage, similar to a sorcerer, or the benefits of intensive study of matters eldritch and strange. Some Warlocks (particularly those with the Pact of the Blade) rely more on their enhanced martial prowess. Others prefer their potent magical abilities.

In Wellspring, those warlocks that identify more with other users of arcane magic may join the [Arcane Order]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-arcane-order), while those of a warrior's bent may join the [City Guard]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-city-guard) or another martially-aligned organization.

#### Character Roles

- **Blaster:** A character who dishes out the hurt at range and against multiple foes. Other classes for this role: Sorcerer, Wizard.
- **Controller:** A character who disrupts enemies and weakens them for their allies. Other classes for this role: Monk, Sorcerer, Wizard.

### Wizard

The archetypal arcanist, Wizards leverage their scholarship and magical talents to reshape the world around them. Some seek to uncover the fundamental truths of magic; others to discover the lost knowledge of the ancients in the depths beneath the city, or to divine hidden or blasphemous secrets of forbidden lore.

In Wellspring, most wizards find the [Arcane Order]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-arcane-order) to be a natural fit, while those of a more mystical bent may join the [Watchers of the Stars]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-watchers-of-the-stars). Wizards who wish to sell magical equipment such as scrolls, potions, or enchanted items may join the [Merchantry Association]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations#the-merchantry-association).

#### Character Roles

- **Blaster:** A character who dishes out the hurt at range and against multiple foes. Other classes for this role: Sorcerer, Warlock.
- **Controller:** A character who disrupts enemies and weakens them for their allies. Other classes for this role: Monk, Sorcerer, Warlock.
- **Scholar:** A character who relies on knowledge and study. Other classes for this role: Cleric (Knowledge domain).
