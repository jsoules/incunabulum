# Table Rules

Rules and guidelines for running and playing the campaign.

## What the DM Says, Goes

You can disagree with a rule or ruling *once*, e.g. “what about X” or “but I thought Y”. If the DM sticks with their interpretation, that stays and we move on.

If you still want to advocate for a particular point of view, feel free to reach out after the game to discuss it, but during the game is not the forum for an extended discussion. We can retcon things as necessary if it’s a serious issue.

## Failure Is An Option

As DM, I’ll do my best to never create an unfair situation for the characters. (The characters are alway free to create unfair situations for themselves, but I’ll warn you. Probably). Even if everything goes wrong, it’s not the end of the campaign (or even the adventure, most of the time). The characters might wake up in jail, or captured by cannibals, or in hock to the Halfling mafia, but the show must go on.

Likewise, character death is something that is always opt-in. A “dead” character is probably out of the battle. In some cases, they may be out of a scene or adventure (but you’ll almost always have something to play or do). But your beloved character will be back.

## Counting Coppers

I don’t care about tracking things like torches, arrows, or common adventuring gear. If you need 50 feet of rope, someone probably has it. If your character has a crossbow, they have enough bolts, and if they fire all of them they still have enough bolts. Likewise, I don’t need to track money for things like meals or inn stays.

## The Party Rolls Once

For some skill checks, it only matters if anyone in the party succeeds, or if anyone fails. Rather than having each character roll individually, these checks are handled as follows.

Sometimes, at least one character must succeed at the check. Examples are a Survival check to find a path through the woods, or a Perception check to spot a hidden ambush. In these cases, I will ask for the *highest* skill bonus and have that character make the roll for the party.

Other times, all of the characters must succeed at the check. One example of this is a Stealth check to sneak past some guards. In these cases, I will ask for the *lowest* skill bonus and have that character make the roll for the party.

In some cases (when cooperation makes a difference), the character may roll with advantage to represent the party helping, but this is only at the DM’s discretion.
