## Player Characters

### Annaroya "Roya" Downdraft

**Played By:** E

Female halfling Rogue.

### Moselle Serenity "Mo" Tristrich

**Played By:** J

Female shoal elf Diviner.

Mo is uncommonly short for her lineage, around 4'10" or 4'11". Her jet-black hair falls to the base of her shoulder blades, and is loosely wavy (though she usually braids it). Her eyes are a deep brown. Her delicate features and large eyes resemble a porcelain doll's; this, taken together with her short height and slim, almost boyish, build, often leads strangers to assume she is an adolescent. She hates this.

As a shoal elf, Mo grew up among people very comfortable with the sea, the outdoors, and each other. Possibly due to her resurgent magical bloodline, or possibly just due to her personality, she felt disconnected from her peers, and preferred staying indoors with books over boisterous socializing. Her family, reasonably prosperous merchants, originally sent her along on trading voyages as a supercargo, navigator. and quartermaster. While she loved the chance to see the world beyond her own community and learn the languages of several different trading partners, she unfortunately could never really get over seasickness, and returned to do accounting in the home office.

But there's very little room for advancement when you work for your parents, your people have professional lives measured in the hundreds of years, and both your family and strangers alike treat you like a child. It was during this time--when she lived through books, and their depictions of the past and of far places, real and imagined--that she took to reading aloud and learning the basics of performance craft as a release from the daily tedium and a way to practice being someone else. Through it all she felt the pull of something greater: both of distant and different lands, and of the transcendent possibilities of the magic in her veins. Eventually she left for Wellspring to pursue that passion through an apprenticeship with its Arcane Order. Her family doesn't really support this move (and certainly resent losing her accounting services), so she's always on the lookout for a new hustle, so she can buy more books, make sure her tuition gets paid, get some rent together, and possibly buy food (in that order).

### Py Hornraven

**Played By:** K

Female half-elf Artificer.

Py grew up in a wandering troup of players, the daughter of an Elf who was the company's props and combat master, and the company's leader, a playwright and musician. She often assisted her parents and the rest of the troupe in their work, and by the time she was eight she was considered a go-to person if anything was broken or needed improvement. A few years later, a stranger joined the caravan as a handyperson. Py was instantly enthralled by the creations of this newcomer, and spent hours sitting by their side at the fire or any setup table, watching them work on intricate mechanisms that seemed to almost have a life of their own. After begging the stranger for weeks and demonstrating her skills, they took her on as something like an apprentice, and in this way Py learned the hidden arts of Artificery.

The stranger stayed with the caravan for a year, and Py spent every waking moment practicing her skills under their tutelage. After they parted company with the troupe, Py left the wandering theater to forge out on her own, eventually attracted to Wellspring's magic and cosmopolitan (to her) population. She quickly developed a customer base with her skilled repairs to almost anything, and supports herself (and her theater/home's prop closet) with her repair work. Py lives in the theater building in a room that is 90% workbench and parts. She believes in using technology to even the playing field, and will go out of her way to gain (borrow? steal?) interesting parts for her experiments, mostly believing that everything should be shared as it was in her caravan. She also has a habit of building and giving away assistance devices to those who can't pay.

### Verity Gray

**Played By:** T

Female human Bard.

Verity Gray is a female human Bard in her early 30s. She was born and raised in the Lower City of Wellspring. Her parents were community organizers and sometime adventurers who loved helping others, hated idleness, and instilled in their children values like solidarity, courage, and persistence in the face of hardship. Verity's older brother, Honor, embodied all that their parents believed: optimism, kindness, and an endless reservoir of empathy, especially for Verity, who shared none of that idealism. Verity has always been the skeptic and the cynic of the family, to the amusement (rather than chagrin) of her parents. Honor always used to say, "She'll come around some day." He was probably right, up until one day when she was 17: her parents took an adventuring contract and never came back. Honor, 20 at the time, tried to scrounge enough money and goodwill to commission a rescue party after them, but no one would take the job. Despite Verity's desperate pleas, he went after them himself. He never returned either. It's been more than 15 years, but Verity still hasn't found him or her parents, and has devoted much of her adult life trying to unravel what happened to her family and why.

Pretty much everyone in the Lower City knows her and loved her family, whose disappearance was among the motivations for the creation of the Delvers' Guild and its insurance program. There was a time when she was pitied; that time has passed. Verity weaponized her underlying curiosity and grief to uncover the city's dark secrets. She now works for the various broadsheets (whoever pays the best this month) and is reputed to never print a lie, no matter how ugly the truth. This makes her both well-trusted and not particularly well-liked. Her typical beat is politics, corruption, murder, and the occasional advice column. In her free time she writes plays. They're all comedies.

## Other Characters

### Cyrene

Female human Cleric/Wizard.

Cyrene is an acolyte of the Watchers of the Stars with a rather sheltered upbringing, who feels rather out of her depth in the city, let alone in the wilderness or the caverns and catacombs beneath Wellspring. She refers to herself as an Astrologian, and uses a mixture of divine and arcane magic. She is physically and socially unassuming, roughly 5'7" or 170cm in height, with the soft build of a scholar, grey eyes, and striking silver hair despite her youth. She typically wears an unadorned grey cloak over a scholar's garb, and carries a staff of dark wood that is inlaid with silver constellations.

### Lavinia Goldfound

Female halfling alchemist, earth-blooded.

Lavinia owns and operates a shop in the Lower City's trades district, with a workshop in back where she brews alchemist's fire in concerning quantities.

### Lucas and Martin

Male human toughs.

A pair of freelance legbreakers. Hired to help shake down the character's community theater troupe, the two are now fans, as well as a connection to the city's criminal underworld.

### The Cleaner

A mysterious gentleman of apparent elvish lineage, astonishing strength, and an unquestionably dapper wardrobe. He disposes of awkward cadavers for a reasonable fee, no questions asked.
