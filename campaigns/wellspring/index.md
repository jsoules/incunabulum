## Adventures

### The Curtain Rises Red

> Date: [10 Centaur]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/life#calendar)

While preparing for a performance at the Silverstone Theater, the characters were interrupted by an acolyte from the Watchers of the Stars, a young woman named Cyrene. She warned that the stars predicted death.

On investigation, they discovered a group of thugs sneaking into the basement with a caged monster, which was accidentally set free. The monster (a Redcap) killed one of the thugs, prompting the others to flee. Two of the intruders were captured, but the leader (a female halfling) escaped into the city. Meanwhile, the murderous Redcap attempted to kill the members of the theater troupe, who managed to put it down with steel and magic.

The characters interrogated the two captured thugs, who gave their names as Lucas and Martin. They did not have any more information on the plot, but were able to cash in a favor with the mysterious Cleaner to dispose of the corpse of the third intruder. Meanwhile, Mo's contacts at the Arcane Order allowed her to sell the body of the Redcap for a small payday.

### A Volatile Tail

> Date: [24 Centaur]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/life#calendar)

Regent Silverstone came by the theater with a manager from the First Bank of Lothian with grave news - due to some questionable legal maneuvering, the city was on the verge of repossessing the Silverstone Theater unless the characters can raise money for fees. Specifically, 400 gold pieces, delivered to the Silverstone Trust's offices no later than noon on 29 Centaur.

Fortunately, Lucas and Martin had a lead on an opportunity to make some quick gold - Martin's cousin's hairdresser's product supplier, a halfling alchemist named Lavinia Goldfound, had suffered a recent break-in. The party went to Lavinia's store and laboratory at the edge of the Lower City. The thieves had stolen several cauldron's worth of alchemist's fire through a tunnel dug into the laboratory. Strangely, the tunnel appeared to have been chewed, not carved. With the help of Sophie, Mo's new magpie familiar, the party discovered that the tunnel led down into sewers.

> Date: [25 Centaur]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/life#calendar)

Pursuing the mystery, the party ventured into the sewers and battled a pair of vicious giant spiders, using Py's homonculus servant as distraction and bait. Fortunately, Roya was able to handily dispatch the eight-legged menaces, with an occasional assist from the rest of the party. In the spiders' web, they discovered a quartet of deceased ratlings, one still clutching broken glassware - some of the apparent culprits of the theft.

Following the trail of broken glass and scorched stone, the party continued deeper to discover a trio of slimes somehow infused with alchemist's fire. Here Mo and Verity's magic took center stage, dissolving the gelatinous terrors with an ironic infusion of caustic acid. As the party had feared, these volatile foes exploded on death, and Py narrowly avoided several such explosions as the combat continued, but in the end the adventurers proved victorious, though not unscathed.

Delving deeper into the lower sewers, the party encountered a helpful patrol of the City Guard, and traded some of Roya's healing expertise for a set of antitoxin - sure to come in handy in these parts. Their good luck continued as they managed to sneak up on a small band of ratlings "guarding" a side tunnel, tossing their precious alchemist's fire onto the ground and cackling about the "Red Dancies". With a combination of clever tactics and deft spellwork, the group killed three of the rat guards and managed to capture the fourth alive.

Here, alas, the party's luck ran dry. Despite insistent coaxing and outright bribery, the ever-hungry creature could not cooperate with demands for the location of its nest, while the party wisely refused a comically obvious trap when the ratling offered to serve as a guide. Instead, the party freed the creature, while setting Moe's familiar Sophia to give chase and report back. Low on supplies and magic, the party elected to return to the surface for a rest; sadly, Sophia failed to return and could not be recalled, suggesting a dire fate in the depths.

The adventurers returned to the surface in the afternoon, and returned the first installment of recovered alchemist's fire to Lavinia. After, they divided their forces, with Moe separating off to re-summon his beloved Sophia. The rest of the party went to the headquarters of the Delver's Guild to gather information on the ratlings they had encounted in the sewers, learning that the creatures were intelligent but treacherous, and cursed with a never-ending hunger. Despite an early social misstep, Roya was able to soothe ruffled feathers and avoid damaging the group's relationship with the Delver's Guild.

The party reconvened back at the Silverstone Theater and took an early rest.

> Date: [26 Centaur]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/life#calendar)

Refreshed and rejuvenated, the party returned to the sewer entrance a few hours before sunrise, and were able to quickly resume following the ratlings' trail. Their pursuit lead them out of the sewers and into a series of natural caves beneath the city. Using their familiars and homonculus servants to scout ahead, Py and Moe discovered the ratling's nest, guarded by several warriors and a ratling sorcerer.

Py used her tinkering abilities to give her homonculus a delicious scent, luring two of the ratling sentries into an ambush. Sadly, Moe's illusory wall gambit failed, putting the remaining ratlings on alert. The party advanced through the tunnels, wielding crossbow bolts and magic against the ratlings with oversized crossbows and slings of alchemist's fire, while Verity engaged the sorcerer in a duel of cantrips.

Just as the party seemed on the brink of victory, the ratlings awoke an ogre-sized compatriot. After devouring one of its own, the giant ratling strode forward with a club the size of a tree trunk. Py coated the oversized club in caustic fluid and then engaged the brute face to face, while Roya used her stealth skills to strike without warning and Moe cast dark illusions to confuse and confound the giant. Finally, just as Py dodged the dissolving remnants of the club, Roya dove forward and under the giant ratling's grasp to bury her rapier in its head, and Verity finally struck down the ratling sorcerer with a mocking cantrip.

Within the ratling's foul nest, the party found a half-dozen more intact flasks of alchemists fire, as well as several small crystals glowing with an inner light - [Magicite crystals]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/magic#magicite-crystals) the ratlings had gathered.

To be concluded...
