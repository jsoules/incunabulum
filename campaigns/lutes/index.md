## Adventures

### The Lay Of The Lost Lute

The Lutemaker's Plight
: Aoife's friend Garrick, a lutemaker of some renown, went missing along with his newly-created masterpiece. Aoife and Jack discovered goblins living in the sewers below Jewel and rescued poor Garrick from the cooking pot; sadly, the masterwork lute had already been sent as tribute to the mysterious King of the Goblins.

The Sunless Citadel
: Aoife and her new friend Lily descend into the depths of a ruined fortress, inhabited by warring bands of kobolds and goblins. Aoife briefly recovers the lost lute, but loses it again to goblin treachery. Deep beneath the Citadel they battle the mad druid Belak, who warns that the elementals will scour clean the land. But not all is lost - along the way, Aoife adopts a baby white dragon, who she names Aurora.

Tremors In Glitter Gulch
: Fire Serpent Pass explodes, dividing the Sapphire Coast from the rest of the kingdom and driving hordes of vicious Fire Snakes into the mining town of Glitter Gulch. Aoife and Lily (and Aurora) manage to rescue a trade caravan, earning the gratitude of Madame Torgga.

The Mystery Of Montaigne Manor
: The lost lute is tracked to the manor of the villainous Merchant Montaigne, but dark deeds and foul schemes are afoot in the City of Jewel. Duchess Harrington has vanished, and a sinister plot threatens to overturn the rule of the Sapphire Coast. With the help of the reluctant Ruby Montaigne, Aoife and Lily infiltrate the manor, discover a cure for the poisoned duchess, and reveal the Merchant Montaigne's dark secret - a demonic altar built deep beneath his manor.

The Hideous Hunting Lodge
: As a reward for saving the Duchy (and the Duchess), Aoife was awarded Montaigne's hunting lodge and lands in the southern woods. Below, Aoife and Lily discovered another demonic altar, and dispatched a trapped fiend.

### The Lost Library Of The Druids

The Annex
: Aoife and Lily are approached by a team from the University of Amaranth, who seek to uncover the Lost Library of the Druids. Swayed by the unbearable cuteness of scholar Taliesin, they now search for a way into the library. The quest takes them to a ruined Annex of the library, where they discover a token of Druid Friendship. Before traveling to the library itself, they resolve to ask the druids directly.

Breaker of Chains
: Aoife and Lily are asked to assist the crew of the fallen Sherem skyship *Sky Dancer* with a delicate problem. The ship's enchanter, Tethost, had attempted to commune with the enraged spirits, but was instead possessed by a powerful demonic entity. The dynamic duo took part in a ritual to draw out and defeat the possessing spirit, a dangerous Hell Hound Alpha. As as reward, Tethost promised to fashion magical armor for the two heroes.

A Detour To Druids
: Far to the south of the Sapphire Coast, Aoife and Lily reunited with Biren the ranger to uncover a festering corruption growing in the forest. Along with a hidden elven village and Ironhide the gnomish Druid, they battled and destroyed a tainted treant in an old druidic grove. Afterward, Ironhide told them some of the history of the Sapphire Coast, and of the four Elemental Temples said to contain the region's awesome power.

### Omake

The Curse of Pumpkin Hill
: Aoife and Lily travelled to a sleepy town beset by a terrible curse, and unravelled the hidden truth behind the horrifying Headless Horse Man.
