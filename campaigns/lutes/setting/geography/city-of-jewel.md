# The City Of Jewel

The largest city and administrative center of the Sapphire Coast, the city of Jewel sits at the region's heart, where the Lesser and Greater Lapis rivers merge. The city is laid out in three districts, from the Docks by the banks of the Lapis to the Upper City on the bluffs high above the rivers.

- [The Docks](#the-docks)
- [The Merchant's Quarter](#the-merchants-quarter)
- [The Upper City](#the-upper-city)

## The Docks

The district closest to the Lapis river is referred to as the Docks. Buildings here are small and the streets narrow, with much of the Docks comprising a maze of alleyways and passages. The district has a reputation for danger and criminality that is not entirely unearned, but the vast majority of those living here are laborers and poorer crafters, or those working in industries (such as leatherworking) that would be unwelcome in more prosperous areas. The part of the docks closest to the Merchant's Quarter has a number of warehouses, owned by merchants relying on cheap land and cheap labor.

Despite the name, proper ships rarely travel as far as Jewel, although the lower Lapis is navigable. The occasional shipment from the Spice Islands far to the south passes through Jewel on the way to the markets of Amaranth, but much more common are barges of lumber from the southern woods floating down the Lesser Lapis, or grain traveling upriver from farms on the Lapis floodplains.

## The Merchant's Quarter

The central district of Jewel is known as the Merchant's Quarter. Built from a mix of wood and stone, the buildings here are larger and the main streets wide and paved with stone. Inns, marketplaces and merchant offices line the streets, while in between are the homes and workplaces of more prosperous crafters. The trade road to Amaranth begins here, departing west along the Greater Lapis before climbing the hills to Fire Serpent Pass.

## The Upper City

The Upper City of Jewel is a small but wealthy district, with the houses of rich aristocrats, local nobility, and the most successful merchants and traders. Jewel's municipal buildings are located here, as well as the headquarters of the City Watch. At the highest point in the city, the Duchess's keep overlooks the river. The Upper City is prosperous but exclusive, and those who look like they do not belong are moved along (not gently) by the Watch.
