# Geography

From the foothills of the Giant's Wall mountains to the shores of the Sea of Storms, the Sapphire Coast is roughly a hundred miles east to west, with the city of Jewel more or less in the center where the Lesser and Greater Lapis rivers merge. Likewise, between the transition from plains to desert in the north, and the point of no return in the southern forest is approximately a hundred miles, with Jewel again more or less in the center.

## [The City of Jewel]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/lutes/setting/geography/city-of-jewel)

The largest city and administrative center of the Sapphire Coast, the city of Jewel sits at the region's heart, where the Lesser and Greater Lapis rivers merge.

### [The Docks]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/lutes/setting/geography/city-of-jewel#the-docks)

The district closest to the Lapis river is referred to as the Docks. Buildings here are small and the streets narrow, with much of the Docks comprising a maze of alleyways and passages. The district has a reputation for danger and criminality that is not entirely unearned, but the vast majority of those living here are laborers and poorer crafters, or those working in industries (such as leatherworking) that would be unwelcome in more prosperous areas. The part of the docks closest to the Merchant's Quarter has a number of warehouses, owned by merchants relying on cheap land and cheap labor.

Despite the name, proper ships rarely travel as far as Jewel, although the lower Lapis is navigable. The occasional shipment from the Spice Islands far to the south passes through Jewel on the way to the markets of Amaranth, but much more common are barges of lumber from the southern woods floating down the Lesser Lapis, or grain traveling upriver from farms on the Lapis floodplains.

### [The Merchant's Quarter]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/lutes/setting/geography/city-of-jewel#the-merchants-quarter)

The central district of Jewel is known as the Merchant's Quarter. Built from a mix of wood and stone, the buildings here are larger and the main streets wide and paved with stone. Inns, marketplaces and merchant offices line the streets, while in between are the homes and workplaces of more prosperous crafters. The trade road to Amaranth begins here, departing west along the Greater Lapis before climbing the hills to Fire Serpent Pass.

### [The Upper City]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/lutes/setting/geography/city-of-jewel#the-upper-city)

The Upper City of Jewel is a small but wealthy district, with the houses of rich aristocrats, local nobility, and the most successful merchants and traders. Jewel's municipal buildings are located here, as well as the headquarters of the City Watch. At the highest point in the city, the Duchess's keep overlooks the river. The Upper City is prosperous but exclusive, and those who look like they do not belong are moved along (not gently) by the Watch.

## The Lapis Valley

The fertile Lapis river valley is the heart of the Sapphire Coast. Centered on the [The City of Jewel]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/lutes/setting/geography/city-of-jewel) at the junction of the Lesser and Greater Lapis, the valley and its surroundings contain most of the burgeoning Duchy's population and wealth.

### Oakhurst

The town of Oakhurst lies on the western trade road to the rest of the Kingdom of Amaranth, approximately two days' ride west of Jewel. It sits roughly on the boundary between the Lapis river plain and the rough country leading up to the Giant's Wall mountains. [The Sunless Citadel](#the-sunless-citadel) lies roughly a half day's travel southwest through rough country.

Oakhurst is best known for its midsummer music festival, which brings bards and performers from across the Sapphire Coast and even from distant Amaranth. Notable locals include Mayor Vurnor Leng, the half-elven constable Felosial, dwarf blacksmith Rurik Lutgehr, and Garon, the proprietor of the Ol' Boar Inn.

### The Sunless Citadel

A great sunken ruin at the bottom of a deep ravine, the Sunless Citadel was once a fortress maintained by the serpentine Forgotten in the distant past. During the invasion by Amaranth, it was briefly held by the defending druids before its destruction sent the fortress into the depths. Now, it serves as a home for those who reject or are rejected by civilization, including warring groups of goblins and kobolds.
