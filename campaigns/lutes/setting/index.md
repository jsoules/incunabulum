# Campaign Setting

A land of classical fantasy adventure, the Sapphire Coast is an idyllic frontier that hides a dark past and faces a troubled future.

- [Geography](#geography)

## [Geography]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/lutes/setting/geography)

From the foothills of the Giant's Wall mountains to the shores of the Sea of Storms, the Sapphire Coast is roughly a hundred miles east to west, with the city of Jewel more or less in the center where the Lesser and Greater Lapis rivers merge. Likewise, between the transition from plains to desert in the north, and the point of no return in the southern forest is approximately a hundred miles, with Jewel again more or less in the center.
