Dark One's Blessing
: When Lilith reduces a hostile creature to 0 hit points, she gains temporary
  hit points equal to her Charisma modifier + her warlock level.

Ear for Deceit
: Whenever Lilith makes a Wisdom (Insight) check to sense if a creature is
  lying, she use the total of her check or 15 (8 + her Wisdom modifier + double
  her proficiency bonus), whichever is higher.

Infernal Constitution.
: Lilith has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned.

### Actions

Thirsting Blade
: Lilith makes two rapier attacks.

Eldritch Blast
: *Ranged Spell Attack:* +6 to hit, range 120 feet, two attacks. *Hit:* 1d10 + 3
  force damage.

Rapier
: *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 5 feet. *Hit:* 1d10 + 3 piercing
  damage.

Insightful Fighting
: As an action (or as a bonus action using Eye for Detail), Lilith makes a
  Wisdom (Insight) check against a creature she can see that isn’t
  incapacitated, opposed by the target’s Charisma (Deception) check. If she
  succeeds, she can use Sneak Attack against that creature even if she does not
  have advantage against it or if no enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it.
  She can use Sneak Attack in this way even if she has disadvantage against the
  target.

  This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until she successfully uses Insightful
  Fighting against a different target.

Sneak Attack
: Once per turn, Lilith can deal an extra 2d6 damage to one creature she hits
  with a weapon attack if she has advantage on the attack roll, or if another
  enemy of the target is within 5 feet of her, that enemy isn’t incapacitated,
  and she doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

Pact Magic
: Lilith casts one of the following spells, using Charisma as the spellcasting
  ability (spell save DC 14). She has 4 3rd-level spell slots, which are
  recovered after a short rest:

  At will: *eldritch blast*, *prestidigitation*, *sword burst*, *thaumaturgy*
  <br />
  4/short rest: *burning hands*, *blindness/deafness*, *command*, *fireball*,
  *fly*, *hold person*, *invisibility*, *scorching ray*, *stinking cloud*.

  Spells Lilith casts ignore fire resistance, and when she rolls damage for a
  spell that deals fire damage, she can treat any 1 on a damage die as a 2.

Infernal Legacy (Darkness)
: Once per day Lilith can cast the *darkness* spell.

Mask of Many Faces
: Lilith can cast *disguise self* at will, without expending a spell slot.

### Bonus Actions

Cunning Action
: Lilith can take a bonus action on each of her turns in combat. This action can
  be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide actions, the Eye for
  Detail action, or to use Insightful Fighting.

Eye for Detail
: Lilith can use the bonus action granted by her Cunning Action feature to make
  a Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a hidden creature or object, to make an
  Intelligence (Investigation) check to uncover and decipher clues, or to use
  Insightful Fighting.

Pact Magic
: 4/short rest: *misty step*.

### Reactions

Hellish Rebuke
: In response to being damaged by a creature within 60 feet of her that she can
  see, Lilith can expend a spell slot to cast *hellish rebuke*. The creature
  must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 4d10 fire damage on a failed
  save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Infernal Legacy (Hellish Rebuke)
: Once per day Lilith can cast the *hellish rebuke* spell as a 2nd-level spell
  (3d10 fire damage). See *hellish rebuke*.

Pact Magic
: 4/short rest: *hellish rebuke*.

Uncanny Dodge
: Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that Lilith can see hits her with an
  attack, she can use her reaction to halve the attack's damage against her.

: *Player's Handbook*, p155

  **Prerequisite:** The ability to cast at least one spell

  Spells you cast ignore resistance to damage of the chosen type. In addition,

  you can treat any 1 on a damage die as a 2.

Eldritch Adept
: *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*, p81

  **Prerequisite:** Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature

  Studying occult lore, you have unlocked eldritch power within yourself: you
  learn one Eldritch Invocation option of your choice from the warlock class.
  If the invocation has a prerequisite, you can choose that invocation only if
  you’re a warlock and only if you meet the prerequisite.

Extra Spell Slot
: *Homebrew*

  **Prerequisite:** Warlock

  You gain an additional spell slot.

Infernal Constitution

  **Prerequisite:** Tiefling

  Fiendish blood runs strong in you. You gain the following benefits:

  - Increase your Constitution score by 1, up to a maximum of 20.

### Magic Items

Hellforged Rapier
: *Homebrew*

  Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a Warlock)

  A rapier forged of dark iron with a silver basket hilt, mounted with a ruby
  that glows with a baleful light. It functions as a Dark Iron rapier enchanted
  as a *pactbound weapon*.

Hell Hound Pendant
: *Tales From The Yawning Portal*, p228

  Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

  This pendant contains the tooth of a hell hound. As an action, you can command
  the pendant to transform you into a hell hound for up to 1 hour. The
  transformation otherwise functions as the *polymorph* spell, but you can use a
  bonus action to revert to your normal form. This item can be used up to once
  per point of Constitution modifier; its "charges" recharge after a short or
  long rest.

Pactbound Weapon
: *Homebrew*

  Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a Warlock)

  A warlock can attune with this weapon as if they had selected the Pact of the
  Blade (see Player's Handbook, p101). Once the warlock has performed the
  ritual, they can use the weapon as their pact weapon, and can gain and use
  items or abilities that require the Pact of the Blade feature. If the pact is
  broken, the warlock may no longer use those abilities until the pact is
  renewed.

  - Pact weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and
    immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
  - Use an action to summon their pact weapon.
  - Dismiss weapon (no action needed).

### Mundane Items

Dark Iron Rapier
: *Homebrew*

  This masterwork rapier grants a +1 bonus to attack rolls and deals 1d10 base
  damage. It is suitable for enchantment.

Leather Coat
: *Homebrew*

  This stylish coat functions as a suit of studded leather armor, providing an
  armor class of 12 + your Dexterity modifier.
