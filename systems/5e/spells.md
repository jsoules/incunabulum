# Spells

## Customizing Spells

Magic is a field of infinite possibilities, and its forms of expression are varied and diverse. Likewise, the spells listed in the *Player's Handbook* and various supplements are only a starting point, and do not represent the full range of possibilities. Different characters or magical traditions often have individual versions or variants of common spells.

Any character with the ability to cast spells can choose a theme for their magic; this should generally be related to the character's nature or a magical tradition they follow. Spells they cast can then be described as following that theme. For example, an Astrologian's *magic missile* spell might be a swarm of shooting stars, while a comedy-themed Bard might use flying gloves or cream pies, and a necromancer might conjure a swarm of screaming skulls.

You can customize the visual, auditory, or other sensory manifestations of a spell in this fashion. You *cannot* make a spell invisible, inaudible, or otherwise undetectable in this fashion, and Customizing your spells in this fashion *does not* change the game mechanics of the spell. For a version of the spell with different mechanics, see [Variant Spells](#variant-spells), below.

Generally speaking, a character's theme for customizing spells should not change without a corresponding significant event for the character, such as multiclassing into a different class. Characters with the [Spell Artist](./feats#spell-artist) feat can customize their spells freely, without sticking to a theme.

## Exotic Spells

Exotic spells represent spells and variants that are rarer, more demanding, or more difficult than other magic. They tend to break the usual rules for spell design, such as having a different class or school than normal, or exchange increased power for some sort of drawback.

Each exotic spell is treated as two spells for the purposes of Spells Known, Spells Prepared, and adding to a Spellbook (including the cost and time required to copy the spell into the Spellbook).

## Signature Spells

Some characters choose a signature spell that best reflects their personality and capabilities. See the [Signature Spell](./feats#signature-spell) feat.

## Variant Spells

Variant spells are a more powerful form of [Customizing Spells](#customizing-spells) (see above), and can change the game mechanics of the spell. Variant spells may change the damage type or saving throw of a spell. In rare cases, a variant spell may belong to a different school. Variant spells that change the spell school, or change the damage type or saving throw from a common one to an uncommon one, are typically [Exotic Spells](#exotic-spells) (see above).

Each variant spell is considered a separate spell for the purposes of knowing, preparing or casting spells, and for adding a spell to a Spellbook. For example, a Wizard character who knows the *ice knife* spell would still have to add the *lava bomb* spell to their spellbook, and would have to prepare it separately in order to cast it.

In rare cases, a variant spell may allow a character to cast a spell not on their regular spell list. Creating or learning a variant whose original spell is not on your character's spell list requires DM approval.
