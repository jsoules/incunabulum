# Feats

Bloodlines and Talents are special feats that provide additional bonuses compared to a regular feat. However, they come with certain restrictions:

- Bloodlines and Talents can only be selected at 1st level, unles you have specific approval from the DM.
- Each character can have at most one Bloodline or Talent, even if they can select more than one feat at 1st level.

## Bloodlines

A Bloodline is a special feat that is (usually) only available at 1st level. Despite the name, a Bloodline does not have to represent a heritable ability; for example, a Bloodline of Fire feat could represent an ancestor's dalliance with a fiery efreeti, a parent who is a famed fire sorcerer, or the result of a laboratory accident involving transmutagenic potions and an unexpected Fire Newt.

| Name | Description |
| [Bloodline of Air](#bloodline-of-air) | The power of the winds flows through your veins. |

## Talents

Talents represent a particular gift the character has for an area of cunning, might, or magic.

| Name | Description |
| [Gift of the Magister](#gift-of-the-magister) | You wield a staff as the symbol of your might and magic. |
| [Gift of the Wizard](#gift-of-the-wizard) | You have a natural talent for studying the arcane arts. |
