# Feats

Bloodlines and Talents are special feats that provide additional bonuses compared to a regular feat. However, they come with certain restrictions:

- Bloodlines and Talents can only be selected at 1st level, unles you have specific approval from the DM.
- Each character can have at most one Bloodline or Talent, even if they can select more than one feat at 1st level.

## Bloodlines

A Bloodline is a special feat that is (usually) only available at 1st level. Despite the name, a Bloodline does not have to represent a heritable ability; for example, a Bloodline of Fire feat could represent an ancestor's dalliance with a fiery efreeti, a parent who is a famed fire sorcerer, or the result of a laboratory accident involving transmutagenic potions and an unexpected Fire Newt.
