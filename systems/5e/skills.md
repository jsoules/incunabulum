## Knowledge Skills

The *Player's Handbook* defines four skills that reflect a character's knowledge about a field of study - Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion.

### Retrying Knowledge Skills

A knowledge check represents a snap, on the spot assessment of the character's command of the subject, and cannot be retried. Likewise, if the desired knowledge could fall under more than one discipline, the character cannot attempt another check with a different skill to obtain the same information.

However, given some time and a reasonably peaceful environment, the character may be able to recall more information. By spending an hour more or less uninterrupted, such as during a short rest, a character may take 10 (adding 10 to their skill bonus) on a knowledge check, even if they previously attempted a check for that knowledge.

### Other Knowledge Skills

At the DM's discretion, a character may begin with or train a skill representing a specialized body of knowledge. For example, Lily the Wizard/Warlock has made an intensive study of demonology and the spells, rituals, and black magics used to breach the barrier between this world and the hells. As a result, she has earned the Diabolism skill, which she could use to identify a ritual circle, recognize forbidden texts, or know the weak point of a powerful demon.

## List of Skills

| Skill | Ability | Classes |
| [Dungeoneering](#dungeoneering) | Wisdom | Bard, Druid, Fighter, Ranger, Rogue |
| [Street Savvy](#street-savvy) | Wisdom | Bard, Fighter, Rogue, Sorcerer, Warlock |

### Dungeoneering

As the Survival skill, but for navigating caves, caverns, and ruins. The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Dungeoneering) check to find your bearings underground, identify the nest of deep-dwelling creatures, track a monster through a forgotten ruin, or detect a collapsing floor or falling stalactites.

### Street Savvy

As the Survival skill, but for navigating towns, cities, and urban environment. The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Street Savvy) check to chase a fleeing suspect down an alleyway, to case a crowded marketplace for pickpockets, to identify the best underground patisserie in the Elven Quarter, or to know who to bribe or shake down for an invitation to the mob boss's party.
