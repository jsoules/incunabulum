## Using Downtime

Downtime is tracked by the [tenday](http://localhost:4000/settings/wellspring/life#calendar). Smaller time periods are too short to make progress on downtime activities, while larger time periods can be tracked as a series of tendays. For example, a full month (30 days) of downtime is represented as three tendays.

Each tenday of downtime, a character can choose one activity to spend time on. If the downtime lasts for multiple tendays, the character may choose to divide them between different activities. For example, over a month of downtime, a character with a crafting ability might choose to spend one tenday forging new equipment, and the remaining two tendays earning additional spending money by selling their services.

A downtime activity is the character's primary focus over that period of time, representing about eight hours of focused effort for eight or nine of the days. Characters on downtime have plenty of time to eat, sleep, and socialize, and can take care of smaller tasks (such as shopping for common equipment), either in the remaining hours or on one of the two rest days in the tenday.

### Downtime And The World

The world does not stand still during downtime. Local events may create new dangers or opportunities, and traders bring word of new developments in distant lands.

## Downtime Activities

Generally speaking, downtime activities fall into one of the following categories:

- [Earning Gold](#earning-gold)
  - [Crafting Items](#crafting-items)
- [Trading Magic Items](#trading-magic-items)
- [Training](#training)
  - [Training Proficiencies](#training-proficiencies)
  - [Training Feats](#training-feats)
- [Socializing](#socializing)
  - [Carousing](#carousing)
  - [With A Contact](#with-a-contact)
  - [With An Organization](#with-an-organization)
- [Investigation](#investigation)
  - [Research](#research)

### Earning Gold

While few activities are as lucrative as active adventuring, most characters can find a way to supplement their income during the quiet periods in between.

In order to determine the gold earned during a week of downtime, make an Ability Check, adding the relevant skill or tool proficiency. Permanent class features such as Expertise and the Rogue's Reliable Talent feature apply to this check, but temporary effects such as Bardic Music, the *guidance* spell, or the Diviner's Portent do not apply (the check reflects the progress of an entire tenday's effort).

Round the check result down to the nearest 5, then multiply it based on the character's proficiency bonus in the table below to determine the total gold earned that tenday.

| **Proficiency Bonus** | **Multiplier** |
| +2                    | x1             |
| +3                    | x2             |
| +4                    | x5             |
| +5                    | x50            |

> *Example*
>
> Aoife is a Bard, and decides to spend her downtime earning money playing the lute in taverns. She has a +2 Proficiency Bonus and a total +7 bonus to Performance (+3 Charisma, +4 from Expertise). She rolls a 15, adds her bonus for a total of 22, and rounds down to the nearest 5, for a total of 20 gold. Because her proficiency bonus is +2, she does not multiply the result.

> *Example*
>
> Dame Savindar is a high-level Fighter who sometimes sneaks incognito into the illicit fighting pits. She has a +4 Proficiency Bonus and a total +9 bonus to Athletics. She rolls a 7, adds her bonus for a total of 16, and rounds down to the nearest 5 for a base of 15 gold. Finally, because her proficiency bonus is +4, she multiplies the result by 5, for a total of 75 gold earned.

Here are some sample downtime activities for earning gold and their corresponding proficiencies:

| **Activity** | **Attribute** | **Proficiency** |
| Crafting | Strength or Dexterity | Artisan's Tools (various) |
| Crime | Dexterity or Charisma | Deception or Sleight of Hand |
| Gladiator Fights | Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution | Acrobatics or Athletics |
| Playing Music | Charisma | Performance |
| Putting On A Play | Charisma | Performance |
| Spellcasting Services | Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma | Arcana, Nature or Religion |

#### Crafting Items

A character with a proficiency in artisan's tools can craft mundane items during their downtime.

Calculate the character's crafting progress using the above formula for calculating gold earned during downtime. The player can spend up to that amount of gold in tools and materials in order to craft items worth twice the amount invested. The character can craft multiple items in a downtime period, up to the calculated total value. If the desired item costs more than the value crafting progress for that period, the progress is banked and the character can continue working on it in a future downtime.

> *Example*
>
> Aunhild is a Dwarven forge cleric with a +3 proficiency bonus and a total +10 bonus to crafting checks. She rolls a 10, for a base result of 20 gold, multiplied by 2 for her proficiency bonus, giving a final value of 40 gold. She can spend up to 40 gold in order to craft items worth up to 80 gold total. She could craft any of the following:
>
> - A suit of scale mail (75 gp) and a mace (5 gp)
> - Eight shortswords (10 gp each)
> - 40 daggers (2 gp each)
>
> Alternatively, she could make up to 80 gp progress on a breastplate (400 gp). She would need to craft the remaining 320 gp in subsequent downtime.

Simple magic items such as scrolls and potions can also be crafted in this manner.

### Trading Magic Items

True enchanted items are rare, expensive, and require time and effort to find and obtain.

The time required for finding a buyer or a seller for a magic item depends on the tier of the magic item and whether it is a minor or a major item (see [Classifying Magic Items]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/magic-items#classifying-magic-items)). As a shorthand, use the following table, based on which Magic Item Table the item appears at in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

| **Magic Item Table** | **Tier** | **Type** | **Time Required** |
| A | 1 | Minor | 1 Tenday |
| B | 1 | Minor | 1 Tenday |
| C | 1 | Minor | 1 Tenday |
| D | 2 | Minor | 2 Tendays |
| E | 3 | Minor | 3 Tendays |
| F | 1 | Major | 2 Tendays |
| G | 2 | Major | 4 Tendays |
| H | 3 | Major | 6 Tendays |
| I | 3 | Major | 8 Tendays |

This time can be reduced by having membership and a high reputation with certain organizations, or by having a positive relationship with or spending a favor from a relevant contact.

### Training

Characters can use downtime to train new proficiencies or even feats. This training is an expensive process, however, and requires gold every tenday per the following table:

| **Proficiency Bonus** | **Gold Per Tenday** |
| +2 | 25 gp |
| +3 | 50 gp |
| +4 | 125 gp |
| +5 | 1250 gp |

#### Training Proficiencies

Characters can train the following proficiencies:

- Skill proficiency
- Tool proficiency
- Language proficiency
- Weapon proficiency

Training a proficiency in this way requires a month or three tendays. These do not need be consecutive.

#### Training Feats

At the DM's discretion, a character may attempt to train a feat during downtime. Typically, training a feat requires three to six months, or nine to eighteen tendays.

### Socializing

Generally, social downtime requires the character to attempt an Ability Check related to one of their social skills, such as Persuasion or Deception. Other checks may be substituted at the DM's discretion - a character may choose to use Performance to impress while carousing, or use Arcana to impress a scholarly contact.

#### Carousing

A less-directed form of socialization. Depending on the chosen social stratum, carousing can represent anything from a series of fancy dinner parties in wealthy manors to a tenday-long bar crawl through the most dubious taverns of the city. Carousing may generate contacts, with a higher social check result making those contacts more favorable inclined to the character.

#### With A Contact

Socializing with a contact may improve the contact's opinion of the character or party, and may generate a favor to be used later. A higher social check result makes the contact more likely to improve their opinion or to grant a favor.

#### With An Organization

Socializing with an organization may improve the character or party's reputation with that organization, and that organization's opinion of the character and/or party. The process may be easier if the party already has contacts with the organization, and in particular if the contacts owe favors to the character or party. A higher social check makes improving the reputation and opinion more likely, and may generate additional contacts with the organization.

### Investigation

Characters may choose to use downtime to perform an investigation. This could involve tracking down or following an individual, attempting to find a way into a location or infiltrate a group, or to find out more information about events in the local area or farther abroad.

A character performing an investigation will generally have to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check, or a Charisma (Investigation) check if they are taking a more social approach. They may also need to make a Deception (Charisma) or Stealth (Dexterity) check to avoid being discovered, depending on the nature of the investigation.

A successful check may give the character information on the subject of the investigation, or clues as to how to follow the matter further. A high check may also generate a contact.

#### Research

As an alternative to a hands-on investigation, characters with access to a library or collection of scholars may attempt to research a related topic. The character should make an Intelligence (Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion) check, depending on the topic under investigation. At the DM's discretion, another [knowledge skill]({{site.baseurl}}/systems/5e/skills#knowledge-skills) may be substituted.

## Downtime Complications

Sometimes, the result of a downtime activity is not as simple as success or failure. If the Ability Check roll (before adding proficiency, ability score, or other modifiers) is 9 or less, the player may elect to take a Complication, in exchange for treating the roll as a 10.

The nature of the Complication is up to the DM, although the player is encouraged to offer a suggestion. Here are some sample complications:

- Some of the purchased crafting materials were of inferior quality and had to be replaced at moderate expense.
- When investigating some shady activity, the character has drawn the wrong kind of attention, and is now being followed around town.
- The bard's performance has drawn the attention of a jealous rival, who is spreading false rumors about the party in the city's taverns.
