Secondary classes is a variant mechanic that allows players to broaden or specialize their characters by picking up some of the benefits of a second class.

It differs from multiclassing in that taking levels in a secondary class does not increase character level, allowing the character to eventually reach their full potential in their choice of primary progression. Characters likewise do not gain additional hit dice from a secondary class (although they may get *better* hit dice), and do not increase their proficiency bonus.

## Why Secondary Classes?

Secondary classes are a form of horizontal progression. They allow characters to grow and develop without growing out of interesting challenges, or adding large amounts of complexity from higher character levels. From a character building perspective, secondary classes make viable character archetypes that would only be possible with potentially crippling multiclassing, or by selecting narrow class specializations such as the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster.

## How It Works

After reaching a progression milestone, the party can either gain a level as normal or to gain or level up a secondary class. The exact mechanics are up to the table - it could be game runner fiat, dependent on the type of milestone (such as a primary quest versus a side task), or subject to a party vote.

If the secondary class option is selected, then each player can choose one of the following options for their character:

- Gain a new secondary class
- Level up an existing secondary class
- Choose a Character Boon

You can level up an existing secondary class, but you cannot select the same class more than once (to gain the 1st-level or higher benefits of the class an additional time). Likewise, you cannot take a class as a secondary class if you already have levels in that class, either as your original class or as a multiclass character.

At the DM's discretion, a character may be able to convert an existing multiclass into a secondary class, allowing them to gain a level in their primary class instead.

## Mechanics

Like multiclassing, when you gain a level in a new or existing secondary class, you gain some but not all of the benefits of that class.

### Hit Points and Hit Dice

Taking a secondary class does not grant additional hit dice - each character only has a number of hit dice equal to their character level. However, taking a secondary class can give a character better hit dice, and the corresponding increase in hit points.

To determine a character's hit dice, add together their hit dice from their primary class (and multiclass, if any) and from their secondary classes. Then, use the best N dice, where N is the character level. Alternatively, discard the dice from lowest to highest until you have a number of hit dice equal to the character level.

> *Example:*
>
> Mialee is a 3rd-level Wizard, and has 3d6 hit dice. Her player decides to take Fighter as a secondary class, which has a d10 hit die. Her hit dice from all classes is now 1d10 plus 3d6, but Mialee is only a third level character, so she only keeps the three highest dice: the d10 and two of the d6. Mialee now has 1d10 and 2d6 hit dice.
>
> To calculate Mialee's new hit points, her character uses the normal rules - 10 plus her Constitution modifier for 1st level, and then either 1d6 or 4 plus her Constitution modifier for her two remaining levels. If Mialee has a Constitution modifier of +1, that gives her 11 + 5 + 5 or 21 total hit points.

### Proficiencies

When you gain your first level in a secondary class, you gain some of that class's starting proficiencies, as listed in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table on page 164 of the *Player's Handbook*. For example, a character who gains a level in Bard as a secondary class would gain an armor proficiency, a skill proficiency, and a musical instrument proficiency, while a character who gains a level in Sorcerer as a secondary class does not gain any proficiencies.

If your character later gains a level in a different secondary class, you gain the listed proficiencies for that class as well. For example, a character who takes Rogue and then Fighter as secondary classes would gain all of the proficiencies listed for both classes. They could later select Bard as a third secondary class to gain an additional skill and musical instrument proficiency.

> *Example:*
>
> Ember is a Monk, with proficiencies in simple weapons, shortswords, and two skills from the Monk list. Her player decides to take Rogue as a secondary class, which grants her the following proficiencies: Light armor, one skill from the Rogue skill list, and thieves’ tools.
>
> If Ember's player later decides to take Fighter as another secondary class, Ember would gain proficiency in medium armor, shields, and martial weapons, since Ember already has proficiency in simple weapons (from Monk) and light armor (from Rogue).

### Class Features

When you gain a new level in a secondary class, you get its features for that level. A few features, however, have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

- [Channel Divinity](#channel-divinity)
- [Extra Attack](#extra-attack)
- [Unarmored Defense](#unarmored-defense)
- [Spellcasting](#spellcasting)

#### Channel Divinity

The same rules as for multiclassing apply when taking a secondary class that grants the Channel Divinity ability. See *Player's Handbook* page 164. You gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by your secondary class, but getting the feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of
it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you.

> *Example:*
>
> Alhandra is a 6th-level paladin, and can use Channel Divinity once per rest, using it to power one of the options from her chosen Sacred Oath. If Alhandra's player takes Cleric as a secondary class, Alhandra will gain the option to use Channel Divinity to Turn Undead, as well as the option for her chosen Divine Domain. She will not, however, gain an additional use of Channel Divinity until her secondary Cleric reaches 6th level.

#### Extra Attack

If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don’t add together.

#### Unarmored Defense

You can gain the Unarmored Defense feature more than once, but the effects do not stack. Only the feature with the highest bonus applies.

> *Example:*
>
> Ember is a Monk with the Unarmored Defense feature. While not wearing armor, nor wielding a shield, her Armor Class is 10 + her Dexterity modifier + her Wisdom modifier. Her player chooses to take Barbarian as a secondary class, which also grants Unarmored Defense equal to 10 + her Dexterity modifier + her Constitution modifier, even while wielding a shield. Ember can choose one benefit or the other, but cannot add her Wisdom and Constitution modifiers at the same time (and while wielding a shield, can only add her Constitution modifier, but not her Wisdom).

#### Spellcasting

If you have the Spellcasting feature from only one class (including your primary class), use the rules for that class. Otherwise, use the rules below.

##### Spells Known and Prepared

You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class.

##### Spell Slots

You determine your available spell slots from your secondary classes by adding all of your levels in secondary classes or class specializations that grant the Spellcasting feature. For class specializations, count the full number of levels (divided and rounded down appropriately), not just the levels since gaining the specialization.

- Add your full levels in classes that grant spell slots of up to 9th level (Bards, Clerics, Druids, Sorcerers, and Wizards).
- Add half your total levels in classes (rounded down) that grant spell slots of up to 5th level (Artificer, Paladin, Ranger).
- Add a third of your total levels (rounded down) in that grant spell slots of up to 4th level (Eldritch Knight, Arcane Trickster).

If a character **does not** have the Spellcasting feature from their primary class, use the relevant class table or the Multiclass Spellcaster: Spell Slots Per Spell Level table in the *Player's Handbook*, page 165.

> *Example:*
>
> Tordek is a Fighter, and therefore does not have a Spellcasting feature. His player decides to take Cleric as a secondary class. Since Tordek does not already have Spellcasting, Tordek gains the full number of spell slots for his cleric levels. If Tordek later took another spellcasting class as a secondary class, he would combine the levels as normal for a multiclass character to determine his spell slots.

Otherwise, using that combined level, you gain spell slots based on the following table.

Spell Slots Per Spell Level
: | **Lvl** | **1st** | **2nd** | **3rd** | **4th** | **5th** | **6th** | **7th** | **8th** | **9th** |
| 1st | 1 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| 2nd | 2 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| 3rd | 2 | 1 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| 4th | 2 | 2 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| 5th | 2 | 2 | 1 | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| 6th | 2 | 2 | 2 | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| 7th | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | - | - | - | - | - |
| 8th | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | - | - | - | - | - |
| 9th | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | - | - | - | - |

| 11th | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | - | - | - |
| 12th | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | - | - | - |
| 13th | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | - | - |
| 14th | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | - | - |
| 15th | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | - |
| 16th | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | - |
| 17th | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 18th | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 19th | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 20th | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

> *Example:*
>
> Vadania is a Druid, with a secondary class of a 5th-level Warlock. She receives two 1st-level spell slots, two 2nd-level spell slots, and one 3rd-level spell slot.

> *Example:*
>
> Devis is a Bard, with secondary classes of a 2nd-level Wizard and a 4th-level Rogue (Arcane Trickster). To determine his spell slots for his secondary classes, he adds two levels of Wizard, plus 1 level (4 divided by 3, rounded down) for Arcane Trickster, for a total level of 3. Devis thus receives two 1st-level spell slots and one 2nd-level spell slot from his secondary classes.

## Character Boons

Character boons provide an alternative to gaining or leveling a secondary class. Each time a character could gain a level in a secondary class, they can instead choose one of the following boons, based on the character's total level.

Unless otherwise stated, a boon cannot be selected more than once. Certain boons can be selected more than once, up to a total number of times equal to one less than your Proficiency Bonus, i.e. only once per tier of play.
