## Customizing Classes

### Proficiencies

With the DM's permission, you can customize your class proficiencies to better suit a character concept. This uses the same rules as customizing lineage proficiencies in *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*. You can replace each of your class proficiencies with a different one of your choice, following the restrictions on the following table.

| Proficiency | Replacement Proficiency |
| Skill | Skill |
| Armor | Simple/martial weapon or tool |
| Simple weapon | Simple weapon or tool |
| Martial weapon | Simple/martial weapon or tool |
| Tool | Tool or simple weapon |
