## Customizing Classes

### Proficiencies

With the DM's permission, you can customize your class proficiencies to better suit a character concept. This uses the same rules as customizing lineage proficiencies in *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*. You can replace each of your class proficiencies with a different one of your choice, following the restrictions on the following table.

| **Proficiency** | **Replacement Proficiency** |
| Skill | Skill |
| Armor | Simple/martial weapon or tool |
| Simple weapon | Simple weapon or tool |
| Martial weapon | Simple/martial weapon or tool |
| Tool | Tool or simple weapon |

## Artificers

### Optional Class Features

#### Runethane

*1st-level artificer feature*

Rather than combining magic and technology, runethanes create their effects by inscribing or carving runes.

A runethane is an heir to an ancient magical tradition that stretches back to the dawn of history - the first runethanes were the Giants, who used rune magic to build an empire and artifacts that still endure to this day. Most runethanes take either the Armorer or the Battle Smith specializations.

## Clerics

### Optional Class Features

#### Cloistered Cleric

*1st-level cleric feature*

Your studies and religious practices are of quiet contemplation, not martial might.

You gain the following class features. This replaces the standard Hit Points and named Proficiencies for the class.

Hit Points
  : **Hit Dice:** 1d6 per cleric level<br>
    **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier<br>
    **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per cleric level after 1st

Proficiencies
  : **Armor:** None<br>
    **Weapons:** Clubs, quarterstaffs<br>
    **Tools:** None

Versatile
