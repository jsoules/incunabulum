## Corsairs of the Star Ocean

A crew of adventurers sails the stars in search of fortune and glory.

It draws influence from modern works such as *Treasure Planet* and *The Dragon Prince* alongside pulp adventures and classical planetary romances.

An original fantasy world with a deep history, a dynamic present and endless opportunities for adventure.

**Genres:** Traditional Fantasy, Medieval Fantasy, Story-Driven Adventure

A land of classical fantasy adventure, the Sapphire Coast is an idyllic frontier that hides a dark past and faces a troubled future.

The Sapphire Coast is designed as an introductory campaign setting for a new player or group, using more or less the standard classes and races from *Dungeons and Dragons* Fifth Edition. It features classical dungeon delves and monster hunts as well as political intrigue, lost ruins, and ancient magics.
