# Wellspring, City of Adventure

A setting of renaissance urban fantasy adventure, set in a city perched on the edge of a fantastical chasm.

The Great Chasm of Wellspring is a wonder like no other. Bottomless, filled with dangers beyond imagining and riches beyond the dreams of avarice, the Chasm is an endless fountain of natural mana, saturating the earth below and the air above with raw magic. Wellspring is designed for urban adventure in a late-medieval or Renaissance fantasy style, with plotting guilds of wizards sharing the streets with steam-powered golems and clockwork servitors. It features dungeon crawls and subterranean exploration paired with urban fantasy intrigue.

## Geography

### The City of Wellspring

The City of Wellspring is located high in the mountains, in a small natural valley surrounding the Great Chasm.

### Wellspring Vale

The Vale is a long valley, gently rising from the foothills to the edge of Wellspring itself, nestled between the peaks. Since the founding of the city is has become densely settled, with forests largely converted to managed timber and the slopes terraced with farmland and vinyards. The once-wild river that courses down the valley's heart is now tamed to feed irrigation and feed the hundreds of locks that carry trade up and down the canal.

Three of the seats are permanently assigned to the heads of the Arcane Order, the Merchantry Association, and the City Guard, while the remaining two seats are elected. Voters must demonstrate residency in the city in addition to a property requirement, either of land (within the city or certain parts of the Vale) or a writ asserting to wealth in one of the city's banks.

The people of Wellspring follow many faiths, and the city holds numerous shrines, churches, and temples. In addition, the abundance of magic draws cults and cabals, building blasphemous altars in the undercity to perform their forbidden rites.
