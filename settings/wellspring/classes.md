## Artificer

*Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*

Artificers are drawn to Wellspring for three reasons - mana, patronage, or adventure. Wellspring's location atop the Great Chasm and its limitless flow of raw mana is an invaluable resource for artificers relying on magical enchantments to power their creations. That flow of mana is matched by a flow of money; the wealthy of Wellspring command considerable resources, and an artifier seeking a patron for their work may find a receptive audience. Finally, for the more independent-minded the vast labyrinth beneath the city provides a lucrative, if dangerous, opportunity to earn funds for further experiments.

A few artificers rely less on magical enhancement for their creations and more on cleverly designed mechanics, creating clockwork toys or even powerful mechanical constructs. This style is rare in Wellspring, although the Free City of Gerlon to the west is known for innovation in engineering and natural philosophy.

Magically-inclined artificers often join the [Arcane Order](./organizations#the-arcane-order), while those more focused on commerce are members of the [Merchantry Association](./organizations#the-merchantry-association).

## Barbarian

Despite the stereotype of the outlander from the wilderness, Barbarians can be equally at home in Wellspring as in the distant wilds. Although described as a "rage", the barbarian's characteristic ability can take many forms. Giantist tradition describe it as a battle lust, while dwarven berserkers rely on an alchemical concoction to trigger a physical and mental transformation. Barbarians are particularly prized fighters in the underground sparring pits, but are equally valued among delvers when venturing beneath the depths of the city.

## Bard

The Bard as a practice mixing music and magic originated with Halflings, and their people have a rich tradition of music and storytelling. Among humans, the folk tradition has grown to encompass everything from common gleemen to formal court bards. The giants have a parallel tradition of war skalds, keeping an oral tradition of great heroes and greater battles. The dwarves employ war chanters, who keep the long lineages of their clans and cities.

In Wellspring, bards can be found among street performers as much as in the halls of the rich and powerful. A few join the [Arcane Order](./organizations#the-arcane-order), but most find their study and regimentation stifling.
