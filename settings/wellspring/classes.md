### Artificer

*Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*

Artificers are drawn to Wellspring for three reasons - mana, patronage, or adventure. Wellspring's location atop the Great Chasm and its limitless flow of raw mana is an invaluable resource for artificers relying on magical enchantments to power their creations. That flow of mana is matched by a flow of money; the wealthy of Wellspring command considerable resources, and an artifier seeking a patron for their work may find a receptive audience. Finally, for the more independent-minded the vast labyrinth beneath the city provides a lucrative, if dangerous, opportunity to earn funds for further experiments.

A few artificers rely less on magical enhancement for their creations and more on cleverly designed mechanics, creating clockwork toys or even powerful mechanical constructs. This style is rare in Wellspring, although the Free City of Gerlon to the west is known for innovation in engineering and natural philosophy.

Magically-inclined artificers often join the [Arcane Order](./organizations#the-arcane-order), while those more focused on commerce are members of the [Merchantry Association](./organizations#the-merchantry-association).
