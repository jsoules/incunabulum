# Character Classes

The character classes in the *Player's Handbook* (and the Artificer class in *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*) are each presented as having a role or place in the game world. A cleric is a holy warrior with powerful divine magic, a barbarian is an outlander with battle rage, and so on. These roles are absolutely valid, and if they match your character concept, please feel free to embrace them. But these roles are only a starting point - they are not the only way a character of these classes can be played.

Want to play a cleric who is a scholarly mystic who studies the divine? Go for it. Want to play a barbarian who is an alchemist with a serum out of Jekyll and Hyde? No problem. You should probably come prepared with *some* reason why your character's abilities match the concept, but beyond that the sky is the limit.

You can also use the rules for [Customizing Class Proficiencies]({{site.baseurl}}/systems/5e/classes#proficiencies).

### Artificer

*Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*

Artificers are drawn to Wellspring for three reasons - mana, patronage, or adventure. Wellspring's location atop the Great Chasm and its limitless flow of raw mana is an invaluable resource for artificers relying on magical enchantments to power their creations. That flow of mana is matched by a flow of money; the wealthy of Wellspring command considerable resources, and an artifier seeking a patron for their work may find a receptive audience. Finally, for the more independent-minded the vast labyrinth beneath the city provides a lucrative, if dangerous, opportunity to earn funds for further experiments.

A few artificers rely less on magical enhancement for their creations and more on cleverly designed mechanics, creating clockwork toys or even powerful mechanical constructs. This style is rare in Wellspring, although the Free City of Gerlon to the west is known for innovation in engineering and natural philosophy.

Magically-inclined artificers often join the [Arcane Order](./organizations#the-arcane-order), while those more focused on commerce are members of the [Merchantry Association](./organizations#the-merchantry-association).

#### Character Roles

- **Armored:** A strong character relying on heavy armor and defenses for protection. Other classes for this role: Cleric, Fighter, Paladin.
- **Crafter:** A character focused on creating and using equipment to become stronger. Other classes for this role: Cleric (Forge Domain).
- **Utility:** A character with a range of abilities rather than focusing on one. Other classes for this role: Bard, Rogue, Wizard.

### Barbarian

Despite the stereotype of the outlander from the wilderness, Barbarians can be equally at home in Wellspring as in the distant wilds. Although described as a "rage", the barbarian's characteristic ability can take many forms. Giantist tradition describe it as a battle lust, while dwarven berserkers rely on an alchemical concoction to trigger a physical and mental transformation. Barbarians are particularly prized fighters in the underground sparring pits, but are equally valued among delvers when venturing beneath the depths of the city.

#### Character Roles

- **Brute:** A character who hits hard and holds territory. Other classes for this role: Druid (in Wild Shape), Fighter, Paladin.
- **Skirmisher:** A fast-moving character who controls the battlefield. Other classes for this role: Monk, Ranger, Rogue.

### Bard

The Bard as a practice mixing music and magic originated with Halflings, and their people have a rich tradition of music and storytelling. Among humans, the folk tradition has grown to encompass everything from common gleemen to formal court bards. The giants have a parallel tradition of war skalds, keeping an oral tradition of great heroes and greater battles. The dwarves employ war chanters, who keep the long lineages of their clans and cities.

In Wellspring, bards can be found among street performers as much as in the halls of the rich and powerful. A few join the [Arcane Order](./organizations#the-arcane-order), but most find their study and regimentation stifling. Bards are also common among the [Harfoot Syndicate](./organizations#the-harfoot-syndicate)

#### Character Roles

- **Diplomat:** A character who uses social skills to stand out. Other classes for this role: Rogue, Sorcerer.
- **Support:** A character who enhances the rest of the group. Other classes for this role: Cleric, Druid, Wizard.
- **Utility:** A character with a range of abilities rather than focusing on one. Other classes for this role: Bard, Rogue, Wizard.

### Cleric

Not all priests or priestesses are Clerics, and not all Clerics are tied to a religious organization or even to a deity. The core element of a Cleric is *faith*. Usually, a cleric believes so strongly in something that magic itself responds - whether in a religion or a deity, a principle, or even a cause. In some cases, however, the connection is reversed. Such clerics find themselves bound to something they may not entirely understand.

Clerics in Wellspring bring their devotion to all that they do, whether it is as part of an organization or as a lone devotee of a cause only they can see. Those of a more scholarly bent may join the [Arcane Order](./organizations#the-arcane-order), while clerics with a more mystical bent may join the [Watchers of the Stars](./organizations#the-watchers-of-the-stars). Clerics with healing ability are also prized by the [Delver's Guild](./organizations#the-delvers-guild) and the City Guard.

Clerics in Wellspring can select the [Cloistered Cleric]({{site.baseurl}}/systems/5e/classes/#cloistered-cleric) class variant.

#### Character Roles

- **Armored:** A strong character relying on heavy armor and defenses for protection. Other classes for this role: Artificer, Fighter, Paladin.
- **Crafter:** A character focused on creating and using equipment to become stronger. Other classes for this role: Artificer.
- **Utility:** A character with a range of abilities rather than focusing on one. Other classes for this role: Bard, Rogue, Wizard.

### Druid

At first glance, Druids may be an odd choice for an urban adventure campaign, but druids can have a strong role even in Wellspring. Druids with the traditional connection to nature have a place in Wellspring, whether as part of the druidic circles in the Bronzewood outside the city or by connecting with the diverse and magically distinct ecosystems beneath the city. Other druids are more scholarly, studying nature magic and its connections. Rather than nature, some druids attribute their powers to elemental spirits.

Druids in Wellspring may join the [Watchers of the Stars](./organizations#the-watchers-of-the-stars), particularly those who study or venerate the stars. Those of a more scholarly bent may join the [Arcane Order](./organizations#the-arcane-order).

#### Character Roles

- **Brute:** A character who hits hard and holds territory. Other classes for this role: Barbarian, Fighter, Paladin.
- **Support:** A character who enhances the rest of the group. Other classes for this role: Bard, Druid, Wizard.

### Fighter

One of the most versatile classes, Fighters rely first and foremost on their martial prowess. In Wellspring, that prowess is particularly valued, both in expeditions beneath the city and when mana surges drive monsters into Wellspring itself. Fighters run the gamut from spell duelists and noble guards in the Upper City to pit brawlers and criminal enforcers in the Undercity.

In Wellspring the [City Guard](./organizations#the-city-guard) and [Stonewardens](./organizations#the-stonewardens) actively recruit fighters, as does the [Harfoot Syndicate](./organizations#the-harfoot-syndicate). Eldritch Knights will sometimes join the [Arcane Order](./organizations#the-arcane-order), while Psi Warriors are sometimes drawn to the elusive [Society of the Third Eye](./organizations#the-society-of-the-third-eye).

#### Character Roles

- **Armored:** A strong character relying on heavy armor and defenses for protection. Other classes for this role: Artificer, Cleric, Paladin.
- **Brute:** A character who hits hard and holds territory. Other classes for this role: Barbarian, Druid, Paladin.
