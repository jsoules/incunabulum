# Religion

The most common religion in Wellspring is polytheistic, and there are many shrines, temples, and churches to different deities. Whether or not an individual is drawn to a specific deity, they will frequently give prayers or make offerings to others in the pantheon. For example, a farmer might give his devotion to the Greenmage, but make offerings to the Storm King for good weather and to the Knight-Errant for the safety of his son, a guardsman.

## Deities Of The Pantheon

The Conquerer
: Patroness of battle, aggressive war, and feats of strength. She is followed by barbarians, fighters, gladiators, and a surprising number of rogues (drawn to her precept that victory is everything, no matter how it was obtained).

  *Domains:* Trickery, War.

The Forge Father
: Traditional patron of blacksmiths. Counts many dwarves among his followers, as well as warriors who rely on heavy armor for protection. Outside of dwarven communities, his worship is in decline, with many turning instead to the Iron Knight or the Mother of Machines.

  *Domains:* Forge (XGE), War.

The Greenmage
: Patron of nature, living things, and the fey. Their followers are frequently druids, rangers, or hedge mages, but they are also worshipped by farmers and hunters, as well as those in need of healing.

  *Domains:* Life, Nature.

The Knight-Errant
: Patron of protectors and honorable combat. She is followed by many fighters, monks, and paladins, who have a fierce rivalry with followers of the Conquerer.

  *Domains:* Order (TCE), War.

The Horned Warden
