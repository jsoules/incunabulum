# Peoples of Wellspring

The following is a partial list of peoples and lineages found in Wellspring.

One important thing to note is the treatment of traditional "evil" races. Goblins and kobolds are not precisely welcome, but neither are they automatically adversarial. Likewise, orcs are omitted entirely, mostly because it's difficult to portray them without unfortunate stereotypes.

## Game Mechanics

As noted in [Character Creation]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/character-creation#ability-scores), characters do not gain an increase to Ability Scores from their lineage. Instead, they can choose one of the following options at character creation:

- Increase one ability score by +2, and a second ability score by +1.
- Increase three ability scores by +1 each.

### Bloodlines

Wellspring is a nexus of magic, and that magic can manifest in the bloodlines of its people. A Bloodline is a special feat that is (usually) only available at 1st level. It typically represents the benefits of a magical heritage, such as a human with Djinni or Efreeti blood.

As a game mechanic, bloodlines largely replace hybrid lineages such as aasimar, genasi or tieflings. A player who wishes to play an aasimar can select a human with a celestial bloodline, or simply a human with unusual features and choose abilities to match the theme. Likewise, a player can choose a dwarf with an elemental heritage, or an elf with a diabolic gift.

For a partial list of available bloodlines, see [Feats]({{site.baseurl}}/systems/5e/feats).

### Humans

Humans make up a plurality of the residents of Wellspring and its surroundings. Humans are a diverse lot, with a wide range of languages spoken daily as well as the common Trade tongue. Humans are visually diverse as well, ranging from the deep shades of the Sherem Magocracy to the north, to the bronze tones of the Free Cities to the west, to the pale tones of those from a distant land across the seas.

Many humans in Wellspring carry the blood of other creatures in their veins. Those with celestial, elemental, or draconic bloodlines are not common, but nor do they tend to draw unwarranted attention. Unfortunately, those who are known carry an infernal bloodline are sometimes viewed with suspicion.

### Halflings

After humans, halflings are the most common citizens of Wellspring; here as in many places, the two peoples find each other easy companions. Nearly all halflings have an elemental bloodline, dividing them into lineages of their own:

- Gnomes have an Earth or (rarely) Metal bloodline. They tend to be slightly shorter and stouter, with a strong connection to the land, and are skilled craftsmen.
- Sylphs have an Air or (rarely) Lightning bloodline. They are known for their talents in illusion magic, and some have the ability to summon fairy-like wings.
- Undine have a Water or (rarely) Ice bloodline. They tend to be playful, with a deep love of songs and stories.

Wood-element halflings are rare, and tend to shun larger settlements in favor of their sylvan retreats. Halflings with bloodlines of fire are very rare, and tend to be visitors from other planes of existance. Those with celestial, infernal or draconic heritage are rarer still.

A lineage of halflings without an elemental heritage lives in a distant land across the sea. Known as tallfolk, it is said they rule a wide empire, although they come to Wellspring as traders and diplomats. They bring strange trinkets to trade, and seem to have a fascination with magic.

### Dwarves

Dwarves are a common sight in Wellspring. Despite their industry and wealth, most dwarves live in the Lower City, preferring a closeness to the earth over the towers and spires above. Below the city proper is Dwarfhome, a largely (but not exclusively) Dwarven community that sits at the terminus of an underground road to Silverhold, a Dwarven city that lies somewhere under the mountains.

Dwarves' sturdy nature makes strong bloodlines relatively rare among them. Of those, earth and metal bloodlines are particularly prized. A lineage of Dwarves with a fire bloodline, known as Azer, are native to a plane of elemental fire and sometimes seen in Wellspring; some have even chosen to settle there.

Some adventurers speak of vast underground cities of dwarves, deep beneath the earth where few surface dwellers ever venture. This underground civilization is said to be at eternal war with some great foe in the darkest depths, preventing a great catastophe from befalling the surface realms. The truth of these rumors is a mystery, but the Dwarven city of Silverhold trades for vastly more material and magic than its size would suggest, and those permitted to enter it have told of great caravans setting out for places unknown.

### Elves

The elves of Wellspring are the descendants of the survivors of a great cataclysm, said to have befallen the elven empires of ancient times. They can be generally grouped into three categories:

- Shoal elves are the most numerous and by far the most common of the elven groups, descendants of those who took to the seas. Lithe and gregarious, shoal elves are natural sailors, and are a particularly common sight around the Free Cities. It is said that their homeland is somewhere in the unending ocean, a hidden island refuge few outsiders ever see.
- High elves are rare and reclusive, the descendants of those who fled to high mountaintops. They are seen but rarely outside of their hidden cities, and are known for harboring magic and ancient secrets from before the fall of their empires.
- Wild elves live in small communities far from civilization, and are likewise rare in Wellspring. Some herd wolves and reindeer in the tundra at the edge of the world; others inhabit the deserts or deep forests. Several wild elf villages are known or suspected to be in the Bronzewood, helping to protect that ancient forest from encroachment.

Shoal elves occasionally embrace bloodlines of Wind or Water, while wild elves tend to favor bloodlines that match their chosen homes, and high elves disdain mixing their heritage at all.

Like other lineages, elves have kin from other planes that may find their way to Wellspring. Coal elves possess a Fire bloodline and are native to plane of elemental fire. They are said to be incomparable metalworkers. Likewise, Eladrin originate from a realm of the fae, while Shadar-Kai are native to murky plane of shadows.

### Giants

Once the undisputed masters of the world, the old giants created great wonders of rune and stone, including a vast network of gates that linked far-flung places and even other planes of existence. Now, the giants live in small, isolated communities or integrated into the towns and cities of humanity.

Virtually all giants bear an elemental bloodline, and tend to form communities with the like-blooded. Of these, fire and frost giants tend to keep to themselves, while stone and storm giants are more likely to visit or settle with other races. Of the giants that visit or settle with other peoples, the average height is around 7-8 feet. It is believed that giants possess a ritual to grant them their famed stature.

### Peoples of the Dragon

Dragons are a rare and terrifying sight, inspiring awe and dread in the lesser peoples of the world. Many seek to serve, steal, or emulate that power.

#### Dragonborn

A dragon in need of a mortal servitor can shape an unhatched egg using magic and alchemy, transforming the child inside from a wyrmling to an approximation of the humanoid peoples. These dragonborn serve as warriors, agents, and emissaries to the dragon, and powerful dragons may have entire communities of dragonborn dedicated to their service. The change breeds true, and some dragonborn seek to leave and explore the wider world, or create a community of their own.

Dragonborn are a rare sight in human lands, even in a city as cosmopolitan as Wellspring.

#### Kobolds

As with dragonborn, kobolds are the result of performing alchemic rituals on an unhatched dragon egg. Smaller and weaker than a dragonborn, a single egg can hatch an entire clutch of kobolds, and they are preferred as servitors by some, especially those dragons unable to perform the full rite. Kobolds hold a respect and reverence for dragonkind, but for each kobold serving a dragon there are countless more inhabiting caves, old ruins, or the less desired places of civilization.

Kobolds are not precisely welcome in most towns and cities, but nor are they an uncommon sight. Their industriousness and sorcerous gifts are sometimes welcomed by outcast communities, criminals, or those on the fringes of society.

#### Mojh

Where dragonborn and kobolds bear gifts of draconic heritage, mojh seek to usurp it. By performing powerful magic and alchemic rites on their own bodies, they transform themselves in an attempt to transcend the limitations of their humanoid forms. In rare cases, this is done with the assistance of an assenting dragon, who adds their magic to the transformation; more commonly, this requires a dark rite using pieces of a slaughtered dragon to empower the change. It is said that the latter bear a "stench" that dragons can detect, earning the eternal enmity of dragonkind.

Mojh are very rare, even in a city like Wellspring, and tend to be solitary or to gather in communities of their own kind to study arcane mysteries.

### Peoples of the Serpent

#### Naga

The serpentine naga are an unusual sight in Wellspring, the high mountain peaks being far from the hot deserts or shallow waters they prefer to call home. They are more commonly found in the jungle rivers of Sherem, or in the inland sea of the Free Cities, but naga traders or scholars are an occasional sight in Wellspring. More rarely seen are their Salamander kindred, a lineage of Naga with fire elemental bloodlines who inhabit a realm of lava and flame.

### Peoples of Iron

#### Goblins

Like kobolds, goblins inhabit dark and liminal spaces such as caves, ruins, and slums. This can frequently lead to competition and violence between the two; likewise, goblins and dwarves hold a deep distrust stemming from centuries of conflict over caves and mining rights. Goblins are rarely welcome in smaller human settlements, but can sometimes be seen making a living at the edges of larger cities. In contrast, halflings bear no particular distrust of goblins, and the latter are often welcome in halfling-dominated communities; this is one of the rare points of friction that halflings have with humans.

#### Hobgoblins

It is said that the ancestors of goblinkind came to this world from the same place as the ancestral humans. Despite or perhaps because of this shared heritage, humans and hobgoblins share an ancient enmity, and the latter are uncommon in human lands. Somewhat paradoxically, in more tolerant cities hobgoblins are more welcome than their smaller cousins, and though never truly embraced can make a good living as soldiers or craftsmen.

### Peoples of Stone

#### Minotaurs

Once, the minotaurs held empires to rival the giants. In the Wars of Stone between giants, minotaurs and dwarves, only the latter emerged victorious, and the minotaurs left scattered in smaller communities deep in the mountains or in deep and hidden halls of stone. In a cosmopolitan city like Wellspring, they are rare but hardly unheard of, and a minotaur guard or runesmith would be a curiousity at most.
