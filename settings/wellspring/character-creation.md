# Character Creation

Wellspring uses some custom, optional rules for creating characters.

## Ability Scores

When creating a character, players should use either the standard array of scores (see *Player's Handbook*, page 13) or the point buy method described under Variant: Customizing Ability Scores.

- The standard array: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8
- The point buy method: Spend 27 points based on the following table.

  | **Score** | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
  | **Cost**  | 0 | 1 | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 7  | 9  |

### Lineages And Ability Scores

Instead of applying the ability score bonus listed for your lineage (see [Lineages](#lineages), below), choose one of the following options at character creation:

- Increase one ability score by +2, and a second ability score by +1.
- Increase three ability scores by +1 each.

### Backgrounds And Ability Scores

[Backgrounds](#backgrounds) do not improve ability scores directly; however, as part of choosing your background you have the option to choose a Feat, which may improve one of your ability scores. You should keep that in mind when selecting your base scores.

## Lineages

The word *Lineage* is used over the historical "Race" as a more neutral option for referring to a character's ancestry. When selecting a lineage, players gain all of the specified benefits of that lineage **except** for the Ability Score Increase, if any. See [Backgrounds And Ability Scores](#backgrounds-and-ability-scores), above.

### Bloodlines

Wellspring is a nexus of magic, and that magic can manifest in the bloodlines of its people. A Bloodline is a special feat that is (usually) only available at 1st level. Despite the name, a Bloodline does not have to represent a heritable ability; for example, a Bloodline of Fire feat could represent an ancestor's dalliance with a fiery efreeti, a parent who is a famed fire sorcerer, or the result of a laboratory accident involving transmutagenic potions and an unexpected Fire Newt.

As players gain levels, they may choose to spend later feats on improving their bloodline abilities, if any.

## Backgrounds

The people of Wellspring come from diverse backgrounds, and those that turn to adventure have a wide range of talents as they begin their journeys. Instead of choosing a standard background, determine the benefits from character's background as follows:

Skill Proficiencies
: Choose two Skills. Your character gains Proficiency in them.

Tool Proficiency
: Choose one tool. Your character gains Proficiency with it.

Language
: Your character knows one additional language.

Feat
: Choose one 1st-level Feat. Your character gains that Feat. This can include a [Bloodline](#bloodlines) feat or a Talent.

Equipment
: Your character gains 50 GP to spend on starting equipment. The character keeps any unspent GP as spare coin.

### Bloodlines And Talents

Bloodlines and Talents are special feats that provide additional bonuses compared to a regular feat. However, they come with certain restrictions:

- Bloodlines and Talents can only be selected at 1st level without DM approval.
- Each character can have at most one Bloodline or Talent, even if they can select more than one feat at 1st level.
