# Organizations

Many organizations and societies, both open and secret, make their home in the City of Wellspring, and many more are drawn to the wealth and the intrigue that flow through the city's streets.

## The Arcane Order

Formally known as the Fraternal Order of the Arcane, the Arcane Order is a guild of wizards, sorcerers and mages. Their library of spells is said to be without equal, and their combined magical might is without question.

In Wellspring, the Arcane Order maintains many of the magical defenses of the city, and its membership is often on the front lines when surges of monsters arise from the deeps. When not protecting the city (a task, to be clear, for which the guild is paid an exorbitant sum), guild wizards are seen as haughty or arrogant, even by the standards of wizards. Their fees for common services are also a frequent cause for complaint among the city's merchantry.

### Membership

The Arcane Order restricts its membership to those capable of casting arcane magic. Members also must pay yearly dues, give the guild a percentage of earnings on sales of magical items or services, and can be required to lend their magic to the guild for ritual magic or the defense of the city. In return, the Arcane Order grants access to their unparalleled library, offers tutoring and mentorship from more senior arcanists (usually for a price), and access to lucrative opportunities from the wealthy and well-connected of the city.

### Headquarters

The headquarters of the Arcane Order is a grand edifice of marble, with a fortified tower jutting out over the edge of the Great Chasm. In addition to the great library, it holds the offices of the guild's leadership, laboratories of the arcane arts, and (it is claimed) vaults filled with powerful enchanted artifacts.

### Relationships

The Arcane Order comes into occasional conflict with the Watchers of the Stars, seeking to bring the more mystically-inclined Watchers under the aegis (and membership dues) of the guild.

## The Delvers' Guild

Founded by a group of retired adventurers, including Dame Savindar, the Delver's Guild is a cross between a trade union and a mutual aid society for those who take on the dangers of the deeps beneath the city. The Guild provides a single point of contact between the notoriously unpredictable adventurers and the institutions of Wellspring.

### Membership

Membership in the Guild requires a nominal fee, mostly to ensure that new adventurers have the resources necessary to survive their first sojourn. Lower-level adventurers benefit the most from the guild's services, while mid-level adventurers often use the guild as brokers to find those with the resources to hire their services or purchase the treasures found in the depths.

#### Services

One of the most important services provided by the guild is a form of insurance. Adventurers can register a delve with the guild, including a planned path and expected date of return. If they fail to return, the guild will send a more experienced party to investigate. This serves two purposes - the promise of rescue can turn an otherwise hopeless situation into a fortified standoff for the lost party, as well as removing a potential danger to other adventurers or even to the city itself. In exchange, a rescued party will often pay a surcharge on guild services for a time, or have a portion of guild contracts garnished, but most adventurers consider this money very well spent indeed.

Another key service is the bounty board, which matches adventuring parties with quests or assignments paid by fellow adventurers or on behalf of others in the city. These can range from "retrieve my favorite bow from the Gallery of Forlorn Notes", to "recover the hide of a cloaker from the Crystal Caverns", to "kill the mutant troll-kin last seen wandering near the underground fighting arenas". The guild takes a cut of each commission, which provides the bulk of its funding.

The guild also provides a marketplace for buying and selling basic equipment, and has contacts for most needs including high-quality weapons and armor, consumable items such as scrolls or potions, or even commissioning magical items. The guild can also provide a contact for selling discovered magic, rare materials or antiquities.

Finally, the guild provides training and mentorship for a fee. Members can learn how to use new weapons or to fight in heavier armor, or to develop proficiency in new skills, tools, or languages. More advanced abilities can also be trained, but this often requires a task or favor rather than gold.

### Headquarters

The headquarters of the Delver's Guild is located in the Lower City. Originally just an inn bought out by a group of retired adventurers, it has grown into a sprawling complex of offices, warehouses, markets, and training grounds, but the heart of the guild remains the old taproom of the *Last Stop*.

### Relationships

The Delver's Guild has generally good relationship with most others in the city. It has something of a love-hate relationship with the City Guard, who view delvers as disreputable at best but rely on their spells and steel when dangerous creatures emerge from the Chasm.

## The Watchers Of The Stars

The Watchers of the Stars are an organization of diviners, scholars and mystics who study the heavens for glimpses of the future. It is said that they master magics unknown to other mages, and that their most powerful adepts can use their knowledge to manipulate the vagaries of fate.

In Wellspring, the Watchers provide an invaluable service, predicing when surges of magic from the Great Chasm will erupt. They are viewed by awe and respect by many, but fear and distrust by others, especially those who have lost people or livelihoods to sudden surges of magic and the accompanying monsters.

### Membership

Lay members of the order are known simply as Watchers, but more highly ranked adepts who can learn the secret magics are called Astrologians. Astrologians can be recognized by their blindfolds and robes with the patterns of the constellations. Most adventurers who affiliate with the Watchers have some form of magic, and are most commonly wizards, or clerics with domains of knowledge or prophesy.

### Headquarters

The headquarters of the Watchers is the Astral Observatory, built into a peak high above the City of Wellspring. Although an arduous climb, the Observatory grants an unparalleled view of the city and an unobstructed view of the heavens.

### Relationships

The Watchers have a somewhat one-sided rivalry with the Arcane Order, who they see as narrow-minded and focused on commerce and influence over the mysteries of magic. That said, a few Watchers are also guild members in good standing, including several high-ranking Astrologians.

## Other Organizations

### The Dragonslayers

The Dragonslayers were once a mercenary company that managed to slay an ancient red dragon which had terrorized a nearby small kingdom. Now they are a regional power, the de facto rulers of that kingdom and soldiers for hire. They are infamous for harvesting the slain dragon's body, wearing armor of dragonhide or dragon scales, wielding weapons forged from dragon's fangs or bone, and using dragon's blood to empower their sorcerers. They are also said to possess several powerful artifacts from the dragon's hoard, in addition to a veritable mountain of treasures.

Their draconic equipment grants them a powerful advantage. Although it is rarely sold to outsiders, it can sometimes be found on the black market, but beware - its bearers will earn the bitter enmity of dragonkind.
