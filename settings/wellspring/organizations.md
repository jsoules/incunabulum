# Organizations

Many organizations and societies, both open and secret, make their home in the City of Wellspring, and many more are drawn to the wealth and the intrigue that flow through the city's streets.

## The Arcane Order

Formally known as the Fraternal Order of the Arcane, the Arcane Order is a guild of wizards, sorcerers and mages. Their library of spells is said to be without equal, and their combined magical might is without question.

In Wellspring, the Arcane Order maintains many of the magical defenses of the city, and its membership is often on the front lines when surges of monsters arise from the deeps. When not protecting the city (a task, to be clear, for which the guild is paid an exorbitant sum), guild wizards are seen as haughty or arrogant, even by the standards of wizards. Their fees for common services are also a frequent cause for complaint among the city's merchantry.

### Membership

The Arcane Order restricts its membership to those capable of casting arcane magic. Members also must pay yearly dues, give the guild a percentage of earnings on sales of magical items or services, and can be required to lend their magic to the guild for ritual magic or the defense of the city. In return, the Arcane Order grants access to their unparalleled library, offers tutoring and mentorship from more senior arcanists (usually for a price), and access to lucrative opportunities from the wealthy and well-connected of the city.

### Headquarters

The headquarters of the Arcane Order is a grand edifice of marble, with a fortified tower jutting out over the edge of the Great Chasm. In addition to the great library, it holds the offices of the guild's leadership, laboratories of the arcane arts, and (it is claimed) vaults filled with powerful enchanted artifacts.

### Relationships

The Arcane Order comes into occasional conflict with the Watchers of the Stars, seeking to bring the more mystically-inclined Watchers under the aegis (and membership dues) of the guild.

## The Watchers Of The Stars

The Watchers of the Stars are an organization of diviners, scholars and mystics who study the heavens for glimpses of the future. It is said that they master magics unknown to other mages, and that their most powerful adepts can use their knowledge to manipulate the vagaries of fate.

In Wellspring, the Watchers provide an invaluable service, predicing when surges of magic from the Great Chasm will erupt. They are viewed by awe and respect by many, but fear and distrust by others, especially those who have lost people or livelihoods to sudden surges of magic and the accompanying monsters.

### Membership

Lay members of the order are known simply as Watchers, but more highly ranked adepts who can learn the secret magics are called Astrologians. Astrologians can be recognized by their blindfolds and robes with the patterns of the constellations. Most adventurers who affiliate with the Watchers have some form of magic, and are most commonly wizards, or clerics with domains of knowledge or prophesy.

### Headquarters

The headquarters of the Watchers is the Astral Observatory, built into a peak high above the City of Wellspring. Although an arduous climb, the Observatory grants an unparalleled view of the city and an unobstructed view of the heavens.

### Relationships

The Watchers have a somewhat one-sided rivalry with the Arcane Order, who they see as narrow-minded and focused on commerce and influence over the mysteries of magic. That said, a few Watchers are also guild members in good standing, including several high-ranking Astrologians.

## Other Organizations

### The Dragonslayers

The Dragonslayers were once a mercenary company that managed to slay an ancient red dragon which had terrorized a nearby small kingdom. Now they are a regional power, the de facto rulers of that kingdom and soldiers for hire. They are infamous for harvesting the slain dragon's body, wearing armor of dragonhide or dragon scales, wielding weapons forged from dragon's fangs or bone, and using dragon's blood to empower their sorcerers. They are also said to possess several powerful artifacts from the dragon's hoard, in addition to a veritable mountain of treasures.

Their draconic equipment grants them a powerful advantage. Although it is rarely sold to outsiders, it can sometimes be found on the black market, but beware - its bearers will earn the bitter enmity of dragonkind.
