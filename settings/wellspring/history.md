## The World of Myriad

This world is known as the Land of the Myriadic Gates, or Myriad.

### Calendars

Wellspring and its neighboring realms use the [Sherem calendar]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/sapphire-coast/calendar), which is based on the constellations. Years in the Sherem calendar are relative to the Convocation, in which the Sherem Magocracy was officially founded by the rival Towers. Years before the convocation are denoted BC, while years since are denoted AC when the year is otherwise ambiguous.

Generally speaking, most inhabitants and visitors of human cities use the local calendar. Halflings in particular tend to use whichever calendar is locally favored, whether that is the human, elvish, or dwarvish calendar. There are several alternative calendars in use by other peoples, but they are not suitable for easy conversion.

- The elven calendars use a 120-year cycle, although where that cycle begins is not consistent between shoal, wild, and high elves.
- The dwarvish calendar uses a simple day ordinal, paying special note to divisions of ten days (the origins of the human tenday), hundred days, and thousand days. For daily use, dwarves tend to omit the thousands place and above - a dwarf might arrange a meeting at the sixth hour on 725, meaning noon on day 3,690,725 of their calendar.
- The giantish calendars track the seasons and the stars, and it is believed that their study of the constellations was influential in the development of the human calendar. However, in the giantish calendary years are given regnal numbers reflecting the rule or stewardship of a particular leader or influential figure. Interpreting a giantish date requires deep local knowledge of that community's people and history.

### The Age of Stone

*Beginning Ten Thousand Years Ago...*

The first peoples to awaken in the dawn of prehistory were the peoples of stone: the Giants, the Minotaurs, and the Dwarves. Of these, the Giants reached the highest, using their mastery of stonework and runic magic to forge a sprawling empire. Their greatest achievement were the Ten Thousand Gates, a vast network of [Runic Gates]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/magic#the-runic-gates) that linked the far-flung reaches of the Giant's empire and even connected it across the planes of existence.

Delving deep into the earth in search of gems and rare stones, the Giants came into conflict with the Dwarves, igniting the Wars of Stone. In their arrogance, the Giants saw their smaller foes as little threat. Were the Giants not rulers of a vast empire, masters of the runes and possessed of legendary skill as warriors? The Dwarves, however, held the secret of metalworking to match the enchanted weapons of the Giants, and proved that great warriors are no match for disciplined soldiers. Though at great cost, the empire of the Giants was cast down, the gate network shattered.

Some scholars believe that as a last act of retaliation, the Giants performed a great and terrible rite, awakening some unspeakable evil in the far distant depths. If this is true, the Dwarves do not speak of it, but some brave delvers have spoken of a vast and ancient Dwarven civilization in the deeps, one at an eternal war with an implacable foe. Either way, the great empires of both the Giants and the Dwarves were shattered.

### The Age of Bronze

*Beginning Five Thousand Years Ago...*

Over the millenia, the broken remnants of the Runic Gates began connecting to places never intended by their creators. On at least two occasions, a Great Conjunction linked gates to far-distant realms of existence, bringing forth new peoples to Myriad. In the First Great Conjunction the Elves and their diminutive kin, the Halflings. Fleeing from some great catastrophe in a realm aligned with the Feywild, the Elves used their own magics and weaponry of bronze to build empires of their own over the ruins of the great civilizations of the past. Those Halflings who did not join their taller kindred built smaller communities of their own in the hills and the forests.

In time, these Elvish empires grew proud and arrogant, and began to battle one another for supremacy. The Wars of Bronze saw civilizations rise and fall, the landscape itself rent and remade, powerful artifacts forged and epic spells created and lost. Of the end, nothing is known - only that the great Elvish empires vanished with barely a trace, an event referred to as The Disappearance. The only survivors were those who had fled; the high elves to their mountaintop fastnesses, the shoal elves to the distant waves, and the wild elves to the untouched corners of the world.

### The Age of Iron

*Beginning Two Thousand Years Ago...*

In the midst of the Wars of Bronze came the Second Great Conjunction, which brought the humans, goblins, and hobgoblins to Myriad. The Disappearance of the elves created both challenges and opportunities, with rich lands now unguarded but plagued with ancient magic and war-wrought monsters. From this chaos, new civilizations emerged, rose, and fell. It was the short-lived but numerous Humans who grew to dominance in this new age, sometimes in conflict and sometimes in partnership with the patchworks of Giants, Elves, and Dwarves. The Halflings in particular were quickly welcomed into most Human societies and viewed as lost kindred.

The recent past has seen the near-dissolution of the ancient [Sherem Magocracy]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/geography#the-sherem-magocracy), a regional superpower that fell to internal strife in the War of the Towers. The rising power in the region is now the [Kingdom of Lothian]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/geography#the-kingdom-of-lothian), whose control of the city of Wellspring grants it a seemingly limitless font of wealth. To the west, the [Free Cities]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/geography#the-free-cities) maintain their historical rivalries and experiment with steam, clockwork, and gunpowder. Meanwhile, traders from a distant land across the sea begin to visit for the first time. It is a time of adventure, of intrigue, of danger, and of opportunity, and some say it is the beginning of a new age: the Age of Steel.

### The City of Wellspring

The origins of the Great Chasm are shrouded in mystery. There are no surviving Giantish records relating to the chasm, but small Giantish ruins can be found in the depths below Wellspring, suggesting that the Chasm is at least as old as the great empire of the Giants, and may well predate it. Even the highly organized Dwarves have few references, though the nearby Dwarvish city of Silverhold refers to regular attacks by powerful creatures of magic.

Within human history, the Great Chasm was largely regarded as a source of significant danger, as upwellings of magic would cause beasts and beings to spill out into what is now Wellspring Vale and further into the lowlands beyond. Brave adventurers would battle up the vale and into the depths; those who returned spoke of strange ruins and great treasures.

This slowly changed as the [Kingdom of Lothian]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/geography#the-kingdom-of-lothian) grew in the lowlands. At first, great fortifications were constructed at the foot of the Vale, protecting the lands beyond from attack. The rich soil of the Vale drew settlers, as did the mineral resources discovered in the foothills, and the mages and soldiers of Lothian built successive walls farther up the Vale, until at last a permanent military camp was built at the edge of the Great Chasm itself. In turn, scholars came to study the chasm itself, founding what would one day become the Arcane Order.

### The First Sherem War

The immense magical potential of the Great Chasm drew the attention of the neighboring [Sherem Magocracy]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/geography#the-sherem-magocracy) to the north. A hundred and fifty years before the present day, one of the Sherem cities declared a war of annexation, seeking to claim the power of the Great Chasm for its own. Fortunately for Lothian the Sherem were distracted by internal divisions and rivalries, and the conflict was inconclusive. Those internal divisions soon grew into a great civil conflict in Sherem, the War of the Towers.

### The Discovery of Magicite

As a result of the Sherem war, the camp atop the Great Chasm grew into a fairly large frontier settlement, supporting the towns and villages in the Vale and providing a conduit for trade between the Kingdom of Lothian and the Dwarvish city of Silverhold beneath the mountains. The difficulty of actually using the raw magic of the Chasm meant it remained largely a curiosity for scholars and a challenge for adventurers, as well as an irresistable lure for occultists and dark cabals. During this time, the Astral Observatory was founded in the mountains high above the city. Much of this activity was funded by the sale of magicite, a crystal that grew in the depths beneath the city and glowed with an inner light. Seemingly harmless, these crystals were coveted as jewelry as far as Sherem and the Free Cities.

Fifty years before the present day, this changed when alchemists and scholars discovered how to extract the magic stored in magicite crystals. While the process was too slow to empower most spells, the potential for crafting magical items and artifacts was immense. Adventurers and delvers from across Lothian and beyond were drawn to seek this material marvel.

### The Second Sherem War

Fearing a sudden change in the balance of power, and coveting the powerful magicite for their own purposes, the Sherem Magocracy launched a second invasion of Lothian. While soldiers and mercenaries from the Free Cities held the border against Sherem mage-infantry and war elephants, a secret strike force of Sherem sky ships flew over the Giant's Spine Mountains to launch a surprise attack on Wellspring itself, hoping to secure the city in a *coup de main*. While the citizens fled into the catacombs, the Sherem bombardment destroyed the fortifications and much of the city before landing a force of elite soldiers.

Unfortunately for the Sherem, the scale of magic wielded in the invasion brought a backlash from the Great Chasm itself. A tide of beasts and monsters poured from the Chasm, causing a three-way battle between the city's defenders and adventurers, the invading Sherem mage-infantry, and the denizens of the depths. The Sherem skyships were overwhelmed by flying beasts, or tumbled from the sky as unstable flows of magic disrupted their flight. A handful of skyships managed to flee; others crashed in the mountains or into the Chasm. With their surprise attack comprehensively routed, the main Sherem force retreated from the border.

### Rebuilding And The Present

In the aftermath of the Second Sherem War, the Kingdom of Lothian invested considerable sums in rebuilding the City of Wellspring. Over the past fifty years, it has transformed from a glorified military camp to a city of brick and now of marble, lead by institutions such as the Arcane Order, the Merchantry Association and the First Bank of Lothian. These changes are not without cost - many of the long-term residents of Wellspring have been driven into the Lower City or even the Undercity as the wealthy build parks and mansions above. This literal stratification is a source of social tension, and an opportunity for those such as the Harfoot Syndicate.
