## The City of Wellspring

The origins of the Great Chasm are shrouded in mystery. There are no surviving Giantish records relating to the chasm, but small Giantish ruins can be found in the depths below Wellspring, suggesting that the Chasm is at least as old as the great empire of the Giants, and may well predate it. Even the highly organized Dwarves have few references, though the nearby Dwarvish city of Silverhold refers to regular attacks by powerful creatures of magic.

Within human history, the Great Chasm was largely regarded as a source of significant danger, as upwellings of magic would cause beasts and beings to spill out into what is now Wellspring Vale and further into the lowlands beyond. Brave adventurers would battle up the vale and into the depths; those who returned spoke of strange ruins and great treasures.

This slowly changed as the [Kingdom of Lothian]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/geography#the-kingdom-of-lothian) grew in the lowlands. At first, great fortifications were constructed at the foot of the Vale, protecting the lands beyond from attack. The rich soil of the Vale drew settlers, as did the mineral resources discovered in the foothills, and the mages and soldiers of Lothian built successive walls farther up the Vale, until at last a permanent military camp was built at the edge of the Great Chasm itself. In turn, scholars came to study the chasm itself, founding what would one day become the Arcane Order.

### The First Sherem War

The immense magical potential of the Great Chasm drew the attention of the neighboring [Sherem Magocracy]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/geography#the-sherem-magocracy) to the north. A hundred and fifty years before the present day, one of the Sherem cities declared a war of annexation, seeking to claim the power of the Great Chasm for its own. Fortunately for Lothian the Sherem were distracted by internal divisions and rivalries, and the conflict was inconclusive. Those internal divisions soon grew into a great civil conflict in Sherem, the War of the Towers.

### The Discovery of Magicite

As a result of the Sherem war, the camp atop the Great Chasm grew into a fairly large frontier settlement, supporting the towns and villages in the Vale and providing a conduit for trade between the Kingdom of Lothian and the Dwarvish city of Silverhold beneath the mountains. The difficulty of actually using the raw magic of the Chasm meant it remained largely a curiosity for scholars and a challenge for adventurers, as well as an irresistable lure for occultists and dark cabals. During this time, the Astral Observatory was founded in the mountains high above the city. Much of this activity was funded by the sale of magicite, a crystal that grew in the depths beneath the city and glowed with an inner light. Seemingly harmless, these crystals were coveted as jewelry as far as Sherem and the Free Cities.

Fifty years before the present day, this changed when alchemists and scholars discovered how to extract the magic stored in magicite crystals. While the process was too slow to empower most spells, the potential for crafting magical items and artifacts was immense. Adventurers and delvers from across Lothian and beyond were drawn to seek this material marvel.

### The Second Sherem War

Fearing a sudden change in the balance of power, and coveting the powerful magicite for their own purposes, the Sherem Magocracy launched a second invasion of Lothian. While soldiers and mercenaries from the Free Cities held the border against Sherem mage-infantry and war elephants, a secret strike force of Sherem sky ships flew over the Dragon's Spine Mountains to launch a surprise attack on Wellspring itself, hoping to secure the city in a *coup de main*. While the citizens fled into the catacombs, the Sherem bombardment destroyed the fortifications and much of the city before landing a force of elite soldiers.

Unfortunately for the Sherem, the scale of magic wielded in the invasion brought a backlash from the Great Chasm itself. A tide of beasts and monsters poured from the Chasm, causing a three-way battle between the city's defenders and adventurers, the invading Sherem mage-infantry, and the denizens of the depths. The Sherem skyships were overwhelmed by flying beasts, or tumbled from the sky as unstable flows of magic disrupted their flight. A handful of skyships managed to flee; others crashed in the mountains or into the Chasm. With their surprise attack comprehensively routed, the main Sherem force retreated from the border.

### Rebuilding And The Present

In the aftermath of the Second Sherem War, the Kingdom of Lothian invested considerable sums in rebuilding the City of Wellspring. Over the past fifty years, it has transformed from a glorified military camp to a city of brick and now of marble, lead by institutions such as the Arcane Order, the Merchantry Association and the First Bank of Lothian. These changes are not without cost - many of the long-term residents of Wellspring have been driven into the Lower City or even the Undercity as the wealthy build parks and mansions above. This literal stratification is a source of social tension, and an opportunity for those such as the Harfoot Syndicate.
