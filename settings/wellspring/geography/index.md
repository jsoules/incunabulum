# Geography

The region is dominated by the City of Wellspring, located in a small natural valley high in the mountains, with the Great Chasm at its heart. To the northeast is the Vale, a great valley sloping down from the city to the distant foothills.

## The City of Wellspring

<!-- ### The Upper City -->

<!-- #### The Noble Houses -->

<!-- ### The Lower City -->

### The Undercity

The area beneath the city proper is known as the Undercity. Officially, this area lies beyond the city's protection, and the City Guard are rarely seen here unless pursuing a fugitive. Those who live in the Undercity tend to be poor, desperate, or unwelcome in the "civilized" parts of the city.

#### Locations

##### Dwarfhome

A fortified community populated largely by dwarves. Wealthy and prosperous, this district would not be out of place in the upper city. Instead, it lies at a middle depth into the Undercity at the terminus of the Underroad, a wide tunnel of smooth stone that leads north to the Dwarvish city of Silverhold, deep beneath the mountains.

Because of its location beneath the city, Dwarfhome faces regular attack from monsters from the Great Chasm and creatures that have dug their way into the Underroad, as well as the usual dangers of the Undercity. As such, it maintains its own force of guardians, known as the Stonewardens.

##### The City Sewers

A marvel of engineering, the sewers carry the city's wastes deep into the mountains. About once a generation, some clever wit suggests avoiding the need for constant maintenance by dumping the city's refuse into the Chasm. The resulting surge in monster attacks (not to mention the stench) makes such policies short-lived.

Despite the merchantry's howls about extortionate taxation, the sewers are actively maintained and repaired by an army of city workers, and occasionally patrolled by whatever City Guard have managed to thoroughly annoy their superiors. Occasional outbreaks of magical fungus, gatherings of ravenous rat-men, or particularly disgusting cults can be driven out by adventurers.

## The Giant's Spine Mountains

Wellspring lies near the heart of the Giant's Spine Mountains. The lower peaks are craggy, with thick stands of evergreens but rocky soil and unpredictable frosts. Higher peaks are snowcapped year round. Several trails lead away from the city deeper into the mountains, too narrow and treacherous to be proper passes, but navigable by the sufficiently determined.

Several communities of giants are known to live in the nearby mountains, with one - the Moot of Mooncarven Stone - known to have close ties with the Watchers of the Stars. Below the northern peaks lies the Dwarvish city of Silverhold, connected to the city itself by the Underroad.

## Wellspring Vale

The Vale is a long valley, gently rising from the foothills to the edge of Wellspring itself, nestled between the peaks. Since the founding of the city is has become densely settled, with forests largely converted to managed timber and the slopes terraced with farmland and vinyards. The once-wild river that courses down the valley's heart is now tamed to feed irrigation and feed the hundreds of locks that carry trade up and down the canal.

### The Bronzewood

A narrow valley leading off from the Vale proper, filled with virgin woods. The woods are claimed by forest elves, but include several communities of halflings who choose to live in communion with nature. Visitors are discouraged, and hunting or logging forbidden by treaty and enforced by elvish arrows.

Those few who venture deep into the Bronzewood uninvited have claimed the woods are far larger than the valley should allow, and inhabited by fey and creatures far stranger. Rarely a denizen of the deep woods will wander out into the Vale proper.
