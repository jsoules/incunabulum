The region is dominated by the City of Wellspring, located in a small natural valley high in the mountains, with the Great Chasm at its heart. To the northeast is the Vale, a great valley sloping down from the city to the distant foothills.

## The City of Wellspring

The City of Wellspring proper is laid out in six districts; three in the Upper City, three in the Lower City.

### The Upper City

The highest part of the city is referred to as the Upper City, where the rich, powerful, and influential of Wellspring live, work, and play. Although most of the city was rebuilt after the Sherem Wars, the Upper City is entirely new, carved into terraces from the raw stone of the surrounding mountains.

  - [The Rabbit's Foot Casino](#the-rabbits-foot-casino)

#### The Civic District

The Civic District is the commercial and administrative seat of Wellspring.

##### The Cathedral of Radiance

When completed, the Cathedral of Radiance will be a towering symbol of the [Church of Light]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/religion#light-and-darkness) and its growing power in Lothian. For now, the cathedral is little more than a foundation, although extensive work has been done in building out the catacombs beneath. Also under construction (and nearly completed) on the cathedral grounds is a chapterhouse of the Knights of the Dawn, an order of paladins closely associated with the Church of Light.

##### The First Bank of Lothian

The First Bank of Lothian is by far the largest single commercial institution with an interest in Wellspring. It provides services for changing and lending money, albeit almost exclusively to the well-to-do of the city. The bank has invested large sums into the rebuilding and expansion of Wellspring, and is said to own large portions of the Upper City.

##### City Guard Headquarters

The headquarters of the [City Guard]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/organizations#the-city-guard) is located in the Civic District, although most of the guards barracks and armories are located in the Lower City, closer to the Great Chasm. The sprawling complex also serves as the city's administrative hub and the meeting place of the city's ruling council, although there are talks of building a dedicated hall for that purpose.

##### Merchantry Association Headquarters

The headquarters of the [Merchantry Association]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/organizations#the-merchantry-association) lies at the heart of the Civic District. While the formal headquarters is a large building of vaulted stone, much of the business is conducted in the surrounding offices. Having a dedicated space within the Association building itself is a mark of considerable wealth and prestige.

#### The Garden District

The Garden District is the home of Wellspring's well-to-do though not wealthy, with rows of townhouses, tree-lined avenues and parks, and shops and restaurants for fine dining and luxuries. Many of the city's houses of worship can be found in the Garden District as well.

##### The Pointed Cap

The unofficial apprentice hangout for the Arcane Order, the Pointed Cap was originally a working class bar called the Bent Horseshoe. After it was gutted in the Sherem Wars, it was rebuilt by its current proprietor, a tiefling who goes by the name Pierre. The Pointed Cap is infamous for its varied cocktail menu, featuring spirits Pierre claims are actually infernal in origin. The building is also strongly warded to suppress spellcasting, officially to prevent student shenanigans, which makes it a useful neutral ground for some otherwise-hostile parties.

##### The Tower Of Knowledge

The headquarters of the [Arcane Order]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/organizations#the-arcane-order) is a grand edifice of marble, with a fortified tower jutting out over the edge of the Great Chasm. In addition to the great library, it holds the offices of the guildâ€™s leadership, laboratories of the arcane arts, and (it is claimed) vaults filled with powerful enchanted artifacts.

The Tower has some spaces open to the public, where petititoners can hire members for spellcasting, research, or to commission or identify a magical item. Access to the Tower proper (and its library) is usually restricted to members, or rarely by a pass from a more senior mage. These passes are almost never granted for mere money, and usually represent the repayment of a favor or the reward of a minor task or quest.

#### The Noble Quarter

The Noble Quarter is the highest point in Wellspring proper, and is the home of the truly wealthy or those few granted a title of nobility by the Kingdom of Lothian. The City Guard are quick to question those who look like they might not belong here, and the private guard forces of some manors or estates are even less welcoming of outsiders.

##### House Savindar

One of the newest of the "noble" houses of the city, House Savindar was founded by a retired adventurer, Dame Luciana Savindar, who leveraged her fortune and connections to become a fixture in the city's social and political scene. Dame Savindar is a founder and major patron of the [Delver's Guild]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/organizations#the-delvers-guild), and is frequently found in the broadsheets, usually under "Scandals".

##### The Rabbit's Foot Casino

An ostentatious (some would say gaudy) complex at the edge of the Noble's Quarter, the Rabbit's Foot Casino is *the* place for the wealthy and powerful of Wellspring to see and be seen, or so claim the well-funded gossip mill. Despite (or perhaps because of) persistent rumors of ties to the Harfoot Syndicate, the Rabbit's Foot makes a point of distinguishing itself from the somewhat sleazy dens of gambling and vice found in the lower districts. The casino proudly boasts the finest imported spirits, games of chance and excitement, and an army of attractive staff of all forms and persuasions to keep the party (and the money) flowing.

### The Lower City

The districts known as the Lower City is where most of the people of Wellspring live and work.

- [The Market District](#the-market-district)
  - [The Fortress Ruins](#the-fortress-ruins)
- [The Trades District](#the-trades-district)
  - [The Delver's Guild](#the-delvers-guild)
  - [The Smoke And Mirrors](#the-smoke-and-mirrors)
- [The Old City](#the-old-city)
  - [The Silverstone Theater](#the-silverstone-theater)

#### The Market District

The Market District is closest to the road and canal to Lothian, and most trade to and from the city passes through its streets. The majority of the city's inns, taverns, and way houses can be found here, along with large warehouses for storage and trade.

##### The Fortress Ruins

The Market District is built over the ruins of the old fortress that once protected the Vale and kingdom beyond from the threat of the Great Chasm. Although ruined during the Sherem Wars, parts of the fortress walls can be found in various places around the markets. Some of the surviving outbuildings have been converted into barracks for the City Guard.

#### The Trades District

The Trades District is where the common folk of Wellspring live, work, and play.

##### The Delver's Guild

The headquarters of the [Delver's Guild]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/wellspring/organizations#the-delvers-guild) is located in the lower city. Originally just an inn bought out by a group of retired adventurers, it has grown into a sprawling complex of offices, warehouses, markets, and training grounds, but the heart of the guild remains the old taproom of the *Last Stop*.

##### The Smoke And Mirrors

A hookah bar in the lower city, with a largely unearned reputation as a den of vice and depravity. The Smoke and Mirrors is also notable for its many halfling-sized tables and rooms, a courtesy that is surprisingly uncommon in a city of Wellspring's diverse populace.

#### The Old City

The Old City is a warren of narrow, winding streets that largely predates the city of Wellspring proper, having sprung up to service the military camp and fortress built to protect the Vale. Badly damaged during the Sherem Wars, the Old City faces the loss of its more well-to-do residents to new homes farther from the Great Chasm. At the same time, the parts of the Old City near the Garden District are at constant risk of being bought out and leveled, and some fear that the Old City and its unique architecture and culture are at risk of vanishing.

##### The Silverstone Theater

A space set aside for the community and the arts, the Silverstone Theater was endowed by a retired adventurer. It currently houses a plucky but struggling community theater program, but its location at the edge of the Old City (and near the expanding Garden District) makes its future uncertain.

### The Undercity

The area beneath the city proper is known as the Undercity. Officially, this area lies beyond the city's protection, and the City Guard are rarely seen here unless pursuing a fugitive. Those who live in the Undercity tend to be poor, desperate, or unwelcome in the "civilized" parts of the city.

#### Locations

##### Dwarfhome

A fortified community populated largely by dwarves. Wealthy and prosperous, this district would not be out of place in the upper city. Instead, it lies at a middle depth into the Undercity at the terminus of the Underroad, a wide tunnel of smooth stone that leads north to the Dwarvish city of Silverhold, deep beneath the mountains.

Because of its location beneath the city, Dwarfhome faces regular attack from monsters from the Great Chasm and creatures that have dug their way into the Underroad, as well as the usual dangers of the Undercity. As such, it maintains its own force of guardians, known as the Stonewardens.

##### The City Sewers

A marvel of engineering, the sewers carry the city's wastes deep into the mountains. About once a generation, some clever wit suggests avoiding the need for constant maintenance by dumping the city's refuse into the Chasm. The resulting surge in monster attacks (not to mention the stench) makes such policies short-lived.

Despite the merchantry's howls about extortionate taxation, the sewers are actively maintained and repaired by an army of city workers, and occasionally patrolled by whatever City Guard have managed to thoroughly annoy their superiors. Occasional outbreaks of magical fungus, gatherings of ravenous rat-men, or particularly disgusting cults can be driven out by adventurers.

## The Great Chasm

The Great Chasm is both the reason for the City of Wellspring's existence and its single greatest threat. A vast rift in the earth of unknown depth, the Great Chasm is a powerful source of natural magic. As such, it draws creatures and monsters of all descriptions, some of which are drawn to the city above (or driven there by even more terrifying beasts from the depths).

In particular, the mana from the Chasm ebbs and flows, and can rarely and unexpectedly surge, driving hostile creatures up into the city in great numbers. These events are referred to as Upwellings. At least twice in the city's past, a Great Upwelling has seen fighting as far as in the Upper City, but even the "average" outbreak is dangerous and can cause significant damage to the lower districts.

## Around Wellspring

### The Giant's Spine Mountains

Wellspring lies near the heart of the Giant's Spine Mountains. The lower peaks are craggy, with thick stands of evergreens but rocky soil and unpredictable frosts. Higher peaks are snowcapped year round. Several trails lead away from the city deeper into the mountains, too narrow and treacherous to be proper passes, but navigable by the sufficiently determined.

Several communities of giants are known to live in the nearby mountains, with one - the Moot of Mooncarven Stone - known to have close ties with the Watchers of the Stars. Below the northern peaks lies the Dwarvish city of Silverhold, connected to the city itself by the Underroad.

### Wellspring Vale

The Vale is a long valley, gently rising from the foothills to the edge of Wellspring itself, nestled between the peaks. Since the founding of the city is has become densely settled, with forests largely converted to managed timber and the slopes terraced with farmland and vinyards. The once-wild Lion river that courses down the valley's heart is now tamed to feed irrigation and feed the hundreds of locks that carry trade up and down the canal.

### The Bronzewood

A narrow valley leading off from the Vale proper, filled with virgin woods. The woods are claimed by forest elves, but include several communities of halflings who choose to live in communion with nature. Visitors are discouraged, and hunting or logging forbidden by treaty and enforced by elvish arrows.

Those few who venture deep into the Bronzewood uninvited have claimed the woods are far larger than the valley should allow, and inhabited by fey and creatures far stranger. Rarely a denizen of the deep woods will wander out into the Vale proper.

  - [Dragon's Fall](#dragons-fall)
  - [The Queendom of Palmyra](#the-queendom-of-palmyra)
- [The Sherem Magocracy](#the-sherem-magocracy)

Wellspring is part of the [Kingdom of Lothian](#the-kingdom-of-lothian). To the east are the [Giant's Spine Mountains](#the-giants-spine-mountains). To the north is the [Sherem Magocracy](#the-sherem-magocracy). To the west is the Sea of Emeralds and the [Free Cities](#the-free-cities). To the south is the [Patchwork Kingdoms](#the-patchwork-kingdoms), a frequently-shifting collection of smaller polities.

### The Free Cities

A collection of independent city-states surrounding the Sea of Emeralds to the west of Lothian. Each of the Free Cities is fiercely independent, and squabbling or outright warfare between them is common, typically conducted by hired mercenaries.

### The Kingdom of Lothian

The land now comprising the Kingdom of Lothian was a lightly settled backwater beset by banditry and monster attacks. An informal cabal of robbers and cutthroats banded together in an attempt to monopolize trade along the Southern Caravan Road, making outrageous demands in the process to the small towns and freeholders of the Lion river valley.

In response, the locals organized together, forging simple weapons in secret and drilling town militias under cover of darkness. Their informal leader was a blacksmith named Arielle, whose forge had been burned down by a bandit lord when she refused to craft him a sword. Over the course of a twenty year campaign, the bandits hold was weakened and finally broken. The people acclaimed Queen Arielle the Lion-hearted as the ruler of a new nation, ruling from a captured keep overlooking the river ford.

The city of Lion's Ford is still the heart of Lothian, although the river had been bridged and the ford itself dredged to allow barge traffic upriver to Wellspring Vale. The kingdom is currently jointly ruled by King Durant and Queen Margot, who are siblings and descendants of Arielle the Lion-hearted. Each has several children by their respective consorts, and while the arrangement is stable for now some worry about a crisis of succession in the future.

To the east, the threat of a tide of monsters boiling down Wellspring Vale has been pacified by the foundation of Wellspring itself. To the north, the neighboring Sherem Magocracy remains Lothian's primary threat, with several wars fought over the magical potential of the Great Chasm. To the south lies the Patchwork Kingdoms, an endless source of banditry and border raids, as well as considerable wealth carried along the Southern Caravan Road. To the west are the Free Cities, which trade up and down the Lion river and carry cargoes from the distant south around the borders of the reclusive Sherem.

### The Patchwork Kingdoms

South of the Kingdom of Lothian are the Patchwork Kingdoms, an ever-shifting frontier of disputed claims and brush wars. Much of the territory is uninhabited badlands or wild frontier, of importance only due to the South Caravan Road which carries exotic luxuries to Lothian, Sherem and the Free Cities.

#### Dragon's Fall

The newest nation in the Patchwork Kingdoms styles itself Dragon's Fall. Formerly a minor principality in the foothills of the Giant's Spine Mountains, it was reknowned for the quality of its wines and the competence of its pike guards. Unfortunately, the discovery of precious metals in the mines drew the attention of an ancient dragon, Razzavinax the Red. He burned the vineyards, slaughtered the guards, and installed himself as tyrant of the vale. A mercenary company out of the Free Cities fought and slew Razzavinax, restyling themselves the Dragonslayers and forging powerful weapons and armor from the dragon's remains. The mercenaries now rule Dragon's Fall as a private fiefdom.

#### The Queendom of Palmyra

The southern terminus of the caravan road is the Queendom of Palmyra, said to contain wealth beyond imagination. Virtually all trade between Lothian, Sherem, and places farther north to the rest of the world passes via caravan to or from Palmyra, to be exchanged for exotic luxuries from lands far across the sea.

### The Sherem Magocracy

The Sherem Magocracy borders Lothian to the north. Politically and magically it is something of a regional superpower, although riven by internal divisions. The five constituent states (known as Towers) are each ruled by a Magister, and each Tower is known for its mastery of a particular area of magic. The Sherem are relatively insular, and while they trade freely with others (Sherem sky-ships are a common sight in Lothian), few outsiders are welcomed into Sherem territory.

## Across The Seas

Somewhere in the vast ocean are the Elven Isles, the homeland of the shoal elves, where few outsiders are ever permitted landfall. Elvish caravels are said to sail every sea in the world, and are of the very few who dare the storms, dragon turtles and uncharted passages beyond the mouth of the Sea of Emeralds to reach the open ocean. All other trade from the southern ports must travel by caravan.

Far beyond the seas, other lands are known to exist. One continent is said to be ruled by halflings, who trade cargoes of tea and cotton in the southern ports. Those traders speak of lands still more distant, where silk and spices flow like water and strange wonders are built of enchanted jade. Other sailors speak of a land ruled by giants, who fought a terrible war against a race of wicked dragons, and of people mixed with wolves and lions and creatures stranger still.
