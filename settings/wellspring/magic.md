## The Four Arcana

The Four Arcana is the dominant model of magic among arcanists and scholars. It represents the natural cycle of magic, and is reflected [in the very heavens](./life#celestial-bodies).

Imagine a graph with two axes, labelled Order-Disorder and Creation-Destruction; these are the basic philosophical principles that underlie magic. The two axes divide the space into four equal parts, each of which corresponds to a unique pairing of those principles.

### The Sacred Arcanum

The Sacred Arcanum is the domain of the heavens, of celestial beings, and of light magic. It is represented by the quadrant of Order and Creation. Sacred magic is strong against the Death arcanum, but weak against the Nature arcanum. Entities aligned with the Sacred Arcanum tend to be altruistic and cooperative but rigid and inflexible.

### The Profane Arcanum

The Profane Arcanum is the domain of the hells, of infernal beings, and of dark magic. It is represented by the quadrant of Disorder and Destruction. Profane magic is strong against the Nature arcanum, but weak against the Death arcanum. Entities aligned with the Profane Arcanum tend to be selfish and destructive, but adaptable and individualistic.

### The Nature Arcanum

The Nature Arcanum is the domain of the fey, not of the natural world but of the hyper-natural. It is represented by the quadrant of Disorder and Creation. Nature magic is strong against the Sacred arcanum, but weak against the Profane arcanum.

### The Death Arcanum

The Death Arcanum is the domain of the undead, of the final end to all things. It is represented by the quadrant of Order and Destruction. Death magic is strong against the Profane arcanum, but weak against the Sacred Arcanum.

### The Arcana And Elemental Magic

At the center, equally balanced between creation and destruction and between order and disorder is elemental magic. This is magic in its most primordial form. Some refer to this as the Balance Arcanum, but adherents of this philosophy are a decided minority.

## The Runic Gates

The Runic Gates are the defining feature of the world of Myriad (literally, the world of the 10,000 gates). Remnants of the ancient empire of the Giants, these stone circles were created in the depths of antiquity by Giantish crafters at the peak of their skills.

Gates were created for three purposes. The most common gates were paired, allowing for near-instanteous travel between distant parts of the world for a minor expenditure of magic. If any such gate pair still exists and functions, it is not widely known. Rarer were the gates linking Myriad to other planes of existence, where the Giants built outposts to gather rare resources or even full colonies. The rarest form of gates were variable, able to change their destination at the Giant's will. If such a feat could be repaired or replicated, the consequences for the people and nations of Myriad could be profound.

Each gate was carved with delicate runes and laid with powerful enchantments, and many gates survive almost intact despite the millenia. Unfortunately, with magic this delicate and powerful, very few gates maintain any sort of function. Explorers are well advised to avoid using newly rediscovered gates, as even those that appear to function may send travellers far afield at random, including to hostile destinations such as high in the sky, at the bottom of the sea, or the heart of a volcano.

The few known surviving gates are planar gates, but here another problem arises - like the stars in the sky, the planes of existence are not fixed over the millenia. Between damage, decay, and planar drift, few gates still connect to a destination at all, and fewer still to their original plane, let alone a location within. Scholars believe that drifting planar gates are how many of the peoples of Myriad came to this world from their now-lost homelands.
