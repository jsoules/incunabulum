- [The Four Arcana](#the-four-arcana)

## The Four Arcana

The Four Arcana is the dominant model of magic among arcanists and scholars. It represents the natural cycle of magic, and is reflected [in the very heavens](./life#celestial-bodies).

Imagine a graph with two axes, labelled Order-Disorder and Creation-Destruction; these are the basic philosophical principles that underlie magic. The two axes divide the space into four equal parts, each of which corresponds to a unique pairing of those principles.

### The Sacred Arcanum

The Sacred Arcanum is the domain of the heavens, of celestial beings, and of light magic. It is represented by the quadrant of Order and Creation. Sacred magic is strong against the Death arcanum, but weak against the Nature arcanum. Entities aligned with the Sacred Arcanum tend to be altruistic and cooperative but rigid and inflexible.

### The Profane Arcanum

The Profane Arcanum is the domain of the hells, of infernal beings, and of dark magic. It is represented by the quadrant of Disorder and Destruction. Profane magic is strong against the Nature arcanum, but weak against the Death arcanum. Entities aligned with the Profane Arcanum tend to be selfish and destructive, but adaptable and individualistic.

### The Nature Arcanum

The Nature Arcanum is the domain of the fey, not of the natural world but of the hyper-natural. It is represented by the quadrant of Disorder and Creation. Nature magic is strong against the Sacred arcanum, but weak against the Profane arcanum.

### The Death Arcanum

The Death Arcanum is the domain of the undead, of the final end to all things. It is represented by the quadrant of Order and Destruction. Death magic is strong against the Profane arcanum, but weak against the Sacred Arcanum.

### The Arcana And Elemental Magic

At the center, equally balanced between creation and destruction and between order and disorder is elemental magic. This is magic in its most primordial form. Some refer to this as the Balance Arcanum, but adherents of this philosophy are a decided minority.
