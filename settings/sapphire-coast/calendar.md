# Calendar

The most common calendar of Wellspring and the Sapphire Coast is the Sherem calendar, which is based on the constellations.

## Divisions of Time

Each calendar year is evenly divided into twelve months of 30 days each, for a total of 360 days per calendar year. Each month is divided into three tendays of 10 days each. Generally, a day is referred to either by month and an ordinal (such as "the 25th of Flame") or by its position in the tenday "next eighth-day".

### Days

Each day is divided into 24 hours, each hour 60 minutes, and each minute 60 seconds.

### Tendays

Within a tenday, each day can be referenced by its ordering, "first-day" through "tenth-day". For example, "come back to pick up your armor by next fifth-day, or we'll melt it down for scrap".

Traditionally speaking, the fifth or tenth days of a tenday are reserved as market days, or days of rest or worship, for those who can afford to take time for leisure. Merchants and shopkeepers will frequently work one rest day per tenday and use the other for trade or personal errands; this ensures that every market day is busy and offers a range of goods and services.

### Months

Each year has twelve months, named after the dominant constellation for that month in astrology. In addition, each month has a "common" name, which can vary from region to region. In the Sapphire Coast (and in the rest of Amaranth), the common names for months are elemental in nature.

| Winter     | Tortoise        | Ocean           |
| Winter     | Hydra           | Waves           |

## Holidays

Traditionally, the solstice and equinox celebrations are held on the rest day of the 15th of Phoenix, Dragon, Unicorn, and Tortoise. In agricultural communities, harvest festivals are more or less ubiquitous, depending on the crops and local weather patterns.

In addition, there are hundreds of holy days and festivals dedicated to different deities, which are celebrated to varying degrees. The truly devout may spend the days in fasting or prayer, while others may give an offering to a shrine or stop to offer a quick invocation.
