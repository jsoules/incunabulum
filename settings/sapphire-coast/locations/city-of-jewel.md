- <a id="characters-gruna"></a>
  **Gruna**<br>
  Female half-orc, fighter. Gruna is the sergeant in charge of training new recruits for the Ducal Guard, and is a daily fixture in the training yard of [the keep](#locations-duchess-keep). She is a retired adventurer, but spends her days teaching fresh meat which end of the sword goes in the bad guys.

  > *Lily's Notes*
  >
  > Gruna is good people. One day we'll get some of those adventuring stories out of her.
- <a id="characters-jack"></a>
  **Jack**<br>
  Rogue. Jack is a member of the [Thieves' Guild](#organizations-thieves-guild), acting as a liaison with trusted outsiders and acting on behalf of the "guild". Not much is known about Jack, aside from a slight build and agile athleticism. They wear a mask at all times and have a preference for tight leather under a concealing cloak.

  > *Lily's Notes*
  >
  > Even I don't know much about Jack, and knowing things is my business. I've never seen under their mask. I don't even know if Jack is their name or a title within the Thieves' Guild. I do know that Jack is trustworthy, and has more than earned their privacy.
- <a id="characters-madame-torgga"></a>
  **Madame Torgga**<br>
  Female dwarf, merchant. Head of the [Deepstone Trading Company](#locations-deepstone-trading-company). A buxom dwarf, atypically clean-shaven "because humans get worked up about the stupidest things". She is a shrewd merchant but cares deeply about her people.
- <a id="characters-rashenna"></a>
  **Rashenna**<br>
  Female half-elf, alchemist. An eccentric local scholar and practioner of questionable magic. She has a mercenary attitude and a well-developed sense of self-preservation. Prickly (and expensive) to work with, but there are few with her knowledge in the Sapphire Coast. She has a ["tower"](#locations-rashennas-tower) in the Merchant's Quarter. Wears a lot of shawls but makes it look good.

  > *Lily's Notes*
  >
  > That sense of self-preservation doesn't seem to extend to her experiments. Be careful.
- <a id="characters-rodric"></a>
  **Rodric**<br>
  Male human, fighter. The captain of the Ducal Guard. He is most commonly found at [the Duchess's Keep](#locations-duchess-keep), although his responsibilities infrequently take him out into the countryside. Gruff and no-nonsense.

- **Stefan**<br>

  >
  > Stefan had the worst case of puppy love I've ever seen. It was hilarious.
  <a id="characters-yasheira"></a>
- **Yasheira**<br>
  Female human, wizard. Head archivist and unofficial court wizard for the Duchess. She is unusually taciturn for a mage, and tends to focus on her duties at the expense of advancing her magic. She is rarely found outside of [the Duchess's Keep](#locations-duchess-keep).

## Organizations

- <a id="organizations-order-of-the-dawn"></a>
  **Order of the Dawn**<br>
  A knightly order of paladins. Does not maintain a large presence in the Sapphire Coast, but the Duchess (herself a semi-retired member) sponsors [a small chapterhouse](#locations-dawn-chapterhouse) in Jewel. Sir Bradford belonged to this order before his untimely demise in the Sunless Citadel.

  *Members:* [Father Grigori](#characters-father-grigori), [Brother Matthias](#characters-brother-matthias), [Duchess Harrington](#characters-duchess-harrington) (retired), Sir Bradford (deceased).
- <a id="organizations-city-watch"></a>
  **The City Watch**<br>
  The official guard force of the City of Jewel. Frequently lazy and corrupt, the watch takes orders from the City Council (local nobility and rich merchants). They patrol the Upper City vigorously, kicking out "riffraff" who look like they don't belong. Conversely, the watch only visits the Docks to "bust some heads", and only in force.

  > *Lily's Notes*
  >
  > Ugh, these assholes. Montaigne was expecting them to back his play for the Duchy, and I think they almost did. Bad business all around.
- <a id="organizations-ducal-guard">
  **The Ducal Guard**<br>
  A military force under the command of [Duchess Harrington](#characters-duchess-harrington), the Ducal Guard is responsible for the protection of the Duchy as a whole. Under the prior Duke's questionable leadership, the Guard was largely neglected and responsibility for Jewel was handed over to the City Watch. A small force, but well trained, well equipped, and loyal to the Duchess.

  The head of the Ducal Guard is [Captain Rodric](#characters-captain-rodric), while [Sergeant Gruna](#characters-gruna) is responsible for training new recruits.

  *Members:* [Captain Rodric](#characters-captain-rodric), [Sergeant Gruna](#characters-gruna).
- <a id="organizations-thieves-guild"></a>
  **The Thieves' Guild**<br>
  Formerly a gang in the Docks of Jewel, their action during the crisis with Merchant Montaigne has allowed them to rise into a position of leadership within the Sapphire Coast's shadowy underworld. While by no means law-abiding, the Thieves' Guild ensure that more dangerous groups such as drug smugglers or diabolic cults cannot gain a foothold in Jewel, and are begrudgingly tolerated by the Ducal Guard.

  The guild is lead by two figures known as the King and Queen, but most interactions with outsiders are handled by [Jack](#characters-jack). They maintain a warehouse full of questionably-sourced goods in the Docks, as well as a more secretive headquarters nearby.

  *Members:* The King of Thieves, The Queen of Thieves, [Jack](#characters-jack), a number of enforcers.

## Locations

The City of Jewel is built on a hill that overlooks the junction of the Greater and Lesser Lapis into the Lapis river. At the river's edge lie the Docks, a rough and tumble district of warehouses and warrens of narrow streets. Farther up is the Merchant's Quarter, a local center of trade and commerce. Finally, the Upper City stands at the hill's crest.

### The Docks

The district closest to the Lapis river is referred to as the Docks. Buildings here are small and the streets narrow, with much of the Docks comprising a maze of alleyways and passages. The district has a reputation for danger and criminality that is not entirely unearned, but the vast majority of those living here are laborers and poorer crafters, or those working in industries (such as leatherworking) that would be unwelcome in more prosperous areas. The part of the docks closest to the Merchant's Quarter has a number of warehouses, owned by merchants relying on cheap land and cheap labor.

Despite the name, proper ships travel as far as Jewel, although the lower Lapis is navigable, but the occasional shipment from the Spice Islands far to the south passes through Jewel on the way to the markets of Amaranth. Much more common are barges of lumber from the southern woods floating down the Lesser Lapis, or grain traveling upriver from farms on the Lapis floodplains.

- **The Cup and Lizard**<br>
  A working-class tavern that burned down when Montaigne's men attacked Jewel. The proprietor returned to Jewel and purchased the former Rusted Flagon in the Merchant's Quarter, renaming it the Flagon and Dragon.

### The Merchant's Quarter

The central district of Jewel is known as the Merchant's Quarter. Built from a mix of wood and stone, the buildings here are larger and the main streets wide and paved with stone. Inns, marketplaces and merchant offices line the streets, while in between are the homes and workplaces of more prosperous crafters. The trade road to Amaranth begins here, departing west along the Greater Lapis before climbing the hills to Fire Serpent Pass.

- <a id="locations-deepstone-trading-company"></a>
  **Deepstone Trading Company**<br>
  The headquarters of the Deepstone Trading Company, [Madame Torgga's](#characters-madame-torgga) burgeoning trade empire.
- <a id="locations-garricks-lutes"></a>
  **Garrick's Lutes**<br>
  A luthier's shop run by [Donella Garrick](#characters-donella-garrick).

  > *Lily's Notes*
  >
  > Lutes are nothing but trouble. Trust me on this.
- <a id="locations-rashennas-tower"></a>
  **Rashenna's "Tower"**<br>
  The home, workplace and laboratory of [Rashenna](#characters-rashenna), one of the few practitioners of magic in the Sapphire Coast. A converted house with several wooden floors built over a stone structure. Precarious looking, but with a soothing, earth-toned appearance and lots of small plants and greenery and many locks. The first floor is a parlor for treating with customers, with living quarters upstairs and a greenhouse and laboratory in the back.
- **The Flagon and Dragon**<br>
  An inn and alehouse in the Merchant Quarter, run by the former proprietor of the Cup and Lizard. Was formerly the Rusted Flagon.

### The Upper City

A small but wealthy district, with the houses of rich aristocrats, local nobility, and the most successful merchants and traders. Jewel's municipal buildings are located here, as well as the headquarters of the City Watch. At the highest point in the city, the Duchess's keep overlooks the river. The Upper City is prosperous but exclusive, and those who look like they do not belong are moved along (not gently) by the Watch.

- **The Apple Blossom**<br>
  An elven patisserie. The prices are exorbitant and the portions tiny, but the taste is unbelievable.
- **Montaigne Manor**<br>
  An imposing manor house, hidden behind walls and patrolling guards. Occupies the second-highest hill in Jewel, below only the Duchess's keep.

  > *Lily's Notes*
  >
  > The contents of the manor have been seized by the Duchy in the wake of Montaigne's treason. Also, we may have set the place just a little bit on fire in the process. Oops.
- <a id="locations-duchess-keep"></a>
  **The Duchess's Keep**<br>
  A walled fortification with central keep that serves as the military heart of the Sapphire Coast and the residence of [Duchess Harrington](#characters-duchess-harrington) and her immediate retainers, including archivist [Yasheira](#characters-yasheira). The keep also serves as the headquarters for the Ducal Guard, including [Captain Rodric](#characters-rodric) and [Sergeant Gruna](#characters-gruna).
- <a id="locations-dawn-chapterhouse"></a>
  **The House of the Dawn**<br>
  A small chapterhouse of the [Order of the Dawn](#organizations-order-of-the-dawn), sponsored by the Duchess. Usually has one older, retired paladin, a couple of acolytes, a priest, and a few servants.
