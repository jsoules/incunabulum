## Characters

- <a id="characters-donella-garrick"></a>
  **Donella Garrick**<br>
  Female gnome, luthier. Proprietor of [Garrick's Lutes](#locations-garricks-lutes), in the Merchant's Quarter.
- <a id="characters-duchess-harrington"></a>
  **Duchess Grace Harrington**<br>
  Female human, paladin. The ruler of the Sapphire Coast and a retired adventurer. She is beloved of the people, who see her as a protector and a counterweight to the corrupt City Watch, merchantry and local nobility.

  She is a retired member of the [Order of the Dawn](#organizations-order-of-the-dawn) and sponsors [a small chapterhouse](#locations-dawn-chapterhouse) in the Upper City.

  > *Lily's Notes*
  >
  > Fortunately, she seems to have learned more compassion than fanaticism from the paladins.
- <a id="characters-gruna"></a>
  **Gruna**<br>
  Female half-orc, fighter. Gruna is the sergeant in charge of training new recruits for the Ducal Guard, and is a daily fixture in the training yard of [the keep](#locations-duchess-keep). She is a retired adventurer, but spends her days teaching fresh meat which end of the sword goes in the bad guys.

  > *Lily's Notes*
  >
  > Gruna is good people. One day we'll get some of those adventuring stories out of her.
- <a id="characters-madame-torgga"></a>
  **Madame Torgga**<br>
  Female dwarf, merchant. Head of the [Deepstone Trading Company](#locations-deepstone-trading-company). A buxom dwarf, atypically clean-shaven "because humans get worked up about the stupidest things". She is a shrewd merchant but cares deeply about her people.
- <a id="characters-rashenna"></a>
  **Rashenna**
  Female half-elf, alchemist. An eccentric local scholar and practioner of questionable magic. She has a mercenary attitude and a well-developed sense of self-preservation. Prickly (and expensive) to work with, but there are few with her knowledge in the Sapphire Coast. She has a ["tower"](#locations-rashennas-tower) in the Merchant's Quarter. Wears a lot of shawls but makes it look good.

  > *Lily's Notes*
  >
  > That sense of self-preservation doesn't seem to extend to her experiments. Be careful.
- <a id="characters-rodric"></a>
  **Rodric**<br>
  Male human, fighter. The captain of the Ducal Guard. He is most commonly found at [the Duchess's Keep](#locations-duchess-keep), although his responsibilities infrequently take him out into the countryside. Gruff and no-nonsense.
- **Ruby Montaigne**<br>
  Female human, fighter. The daughter of the nefarious merchant Montaigne. A skilled wielder of the rapier, Ruby is seeking work as a guard or soldier of fortune after the fall of her father's merchant empire.
- **Stefan**
  Male human, fighter. A page at [the Duchess's keep](#locations-duchess-keep).

  > *Lily's Notes*
  >
  > Stefan had the worst case of puppy love I've ever seen. It was hilarious.
  <a id="characters-yasheira"></a>
- **Yasheira**<br>
  Female human, wizard. Head archivist and unofficial court wizard for the Duchess. She is unusually taciturn for a mage, and tends to focus on her duties at the expense of advancing her magic. She is rarely found outside of [the Duchess's Keep](#locations-duchess-keep).

## Organizations

- <a id="organizations-order-of-the-dawn">
  **Order of the Dawn**<br>
  A knightly order of paladins. Does not maintain a large presence in the Sapphire Coast, but the Duchess (herself a semi-retired member) sponsors [a small chapterhouse](#locations-dawn-chapterhouse) in Jewel. Sir Bradford belonged to this order before his untimely demise in the Sunless Citadel.

  *Members:* Father Grigori, Brother Matthias, [Duchess Harrington](#characters-duchess-harrington) (retired), Sir Bradford (deceased).

## Locations

### The Docks

- **The Cup and Lizard**<br>
  A working-class tavern that burned down when Montaigne's men attacked Jewel. The proprietor returned to Jewel and purchased the former Rusted Flagon in the Merchant's Quarter, renaming it the Flagon and Dragon.

### The Merchant's Quarter

- <a id="locations-deepstone-trading-company"></a>
  **Deepstone Trading Company**<br>
  The headquarters of the Deepstone Trading Company, [Madame Torgga's](#characters-madame-torgga) burgeoning trade empire.
- <a id="locations-garricks-lutes"></a>
  **Garrick's Lutes**<br>
  A luthier's shop run by [Donella Garrick](#characters-donella-garrick).

  > *Lily's Notes*
  >
  > Lutes are nothing but trouble. Trust me on this.
- <a id="locations-rashennas-tower"></a>
  **Rashenna's "Tower"**<br>
  The home, workplace and laboratory of [Rashenna](#characters-rashenna), one of the few practitioners of magic in the Sapphire Coast. A converted house with several wooden floors built over a stone structure. Precarious looking, but with a soothing, earth-toned appearance and lots of small plants and greenery and many locks. The first floor is a parlor for treating with customers, with living quarters upstairs and a greenhouse and laboratory in the back.
- **The Flagon and Dragon**<br>
  An inn and alehouse in the Merchant Quarter, run by the former proprietor of the Cup and Lizard. Was formerly the Rusted Flagon.

### The Upper City

- **The Apple Blossom**<br>
  An elven patisserie. The prices are exorbitant and the portions tiny, but the taste is unbelievable.
- **Montaigne Manor**<br>
  An imposing manor house, hidden behind walls and patrolling guards. Occupies the second-highest hill in Jewel, below only the Duchess's keep.

  > *Lily's Notes*
  >
  > The contents of the manor have been seized by the Duchy in the wake of Montaigne's treason. Also, we may have set the place just a little bit on fire in the process. Oops.
- <a id="locations-duchess-keep"></a>
  **The Duchess's Keep**<br>
  A walled fortification with central keep that serves as the military heart of the Sapphire Coast and the residence of [Duchess Harrington](#characters-duchess-harrington) and her immediate retainers, including archivist [Yasheira](#characters-yasheira). The keep also serves as the headquarters for the Ducal Guard, including [Captain Rodric](#characters-rodric) and [Sergeant Gruna](#characters-gruna).
- <a id="locations-dawn-chapterhouse"></a>
  **The House of the Dawn**<br>
  A small chapterhouse of the [Order of the Dawn](#organizations-order-of-the-dawn), sponsored by the Duchess. Usually has one older, retired paladin, a couple of acolytes, a priest, and a few servants.
