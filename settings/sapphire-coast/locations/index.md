# Locations

## The Sapphire Coast

The Sapphire Coast is bounded by geography on all sides. To the west, the Giant's Wall mountains separate the Sapphire Coast from the parent Kingdom of Amaranth, linked only by the volatile Fire Serpent Pass. To the north, arid plains turn to parched desert, while to the south dense forests turn into impassible jungles. To the east is the Sea of Storms, allowing trade with the Spice Islands and (very distantly, via the Sea of Emeralds and the Free Cities) Amaranth.

- **Fire Serpent Pass**<br>
  A narrow, winding pass through the Giant's Wall mountains, this is the only land route between the Sapphire Coast and the rest of the Kingdom of Amaranth. It is named after the Twin Fires, a pair of active volcanos that can be seen from the pass - the flowing rivers of lava are said to resemble fiery serpents.
- **Giant's Wall**<br>
  The mountain range separating the Sapphire Coast from the Kingdom of Amaranth. It is impassible aside from Fire Serpent Pass, with rough hill rising to dramatic snow-capped peaks. Local legends tell of a Dwarven city that lies abandoned somewhere in its depths, and trappers speak of clans of giants that inhabit the remote peaks.
- **The Lapis River**<br>
  The main waterway within the Sapphire Coast, connecting the city of Jewel to the Sea of Storms. It is navigable by barge or lighter vessels as far as Jewel herself. Upstream, the river splits into the Greater Lapis (flowing from the Giant's Wall mountains) and the Lesser Lapis (flowing from the southern forest).
- **The Sea of Storms**<br>
  To the east of the Sapphire Coast lies the Sea of Storms, with bountiful fisheries and rich beds of shellfish and abalone. Vessels sailing south and east can reach the exotic Spice Islands, while following the coast will eventually lead west and back north to the Sea of Emeralds and the Free Cities.
