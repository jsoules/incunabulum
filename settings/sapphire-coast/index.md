# The Sapphire Coast

**Genres:** Traditional Fantasy, Medieval Fantasy, Story-Driven Adventure

A land of classical fantasy adventure, the Sapphire Coast is an idyllic frontier that hides a dark past and faces a troubled future.

> The Sapphire Coast is designed as an introductory campaign setting for a new player or group, using more or less the standard classes and races from *Dungeons and Dragons* Fifth Edition. It features classical dungeon delves and monster hunts as well as political intrigue, lost ruins, and ancient magics.

The Duchy of the Sapphire Coast is a remote region, far from the heart of the kingdom but rich in natural resources. Its capital city is Jewel, a small city compared to the heartlands, but prosperous. The region is ruled by the Duchess Harrington, a former adventurer who earned the favor of the Queen.

## Geography

The Sapphire Coast is bounded by geography on all sides. To the west, the Giant's Wall mountains separate the Sapphire Coast from the parent Kingdom of Amaranth, linked only by the volatile Fire Serpent Pass. To the north, arid plains turn to parched desert, while to the south dense forests turn into impassible jungles. To the east is the Sea of Storms, allowing trade with the Spice Islands and (very distantly, via the Sea of Emeralds and the Free Cities) Amaranth.

- **Fire Serpent Pass**<br>
  A narrow, winding pass through the Giant's Wall mountains, this is the only land route between the Sapphire Coast and the rest of the Kingdom of Amaranth. It is named after the Twin Fires, a pair of active volcanos that can be seen from the pass - the flowing rivers of lava are said to resemble fiery serpents.
- **Giant's Wall**<br>
  The mountain range separating the Sapphire Coast from the Kingdom of Amaranth. It is impassible aside from Fire Serpent Pass, with rough hill rising to dramatic snow-capped peaks. Local legends tell of a Dwarven city that lies abandoned somewhere in its depths, and trappers speak of clans of giants that inhabit the remote peaks.
- **The Facet River**<br>
  The main waterway within the Sapphire Coast, connecting the city of Jewel to the Sea of Storms. It is navigable by barge or lighter vessels as far as Jewel herself. Upstream, the river splits into the Greater Facet (flowing from the Giant's Wall mountains) and the Lesser Facet (flowing from the southern forest).
- **The Sea of Storms**<br>
  To the east of the Sapphire Coast lies the Sea of Storms, with bountiful fisheries and rich beds of shellfish and abalone. Vessels sailing south and east can reach the exotic Spice Islands, while following the coast will eventually lead west and back north to the Sea of Emeralds and the Free Cities.

[The City of Jewel]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/sapphire-coast/locations/city-of-jewel) is the only major settlement in the Sapphire Coast, although by the standards of the rest of the kingdom it is barely a city. Fields, orchards, and farming villages ring Jewel and follow the course of the Facet. Beyond lies wilderness, with mining towns in the foothills of the Giant's Wall and logging camps in the southern forests.

## History

The Sapphire Coast was once populated by wild elementals, although they have not been seen since the land was settled.

The Sapphire Coast was settled a hundred years ago, but there are ruins from much older civilizations scattered around. The current Duchess is Grace Harrington, a retired paladin and adventurer.

## Recent Events

There has long been tension between the elemental druids of the Sapphire Coast and the priests of the temples in the towns and cities. This tension has escalated of late, with the priests feeling emboldened by the appointment of a paladin as Duchess.
