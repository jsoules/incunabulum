# The Sapphire Coast

**Genres:** Traditional Fantasy, Medieval Fantasy, Story-Driven Adventure

A land of classical fantasy adventure, the Sapphire Coast is an idyllic frontier that hides a dark past and faces a troubled future.

> The Sapphire Coast is designed as an introductory campaign setting for a new player or group, using more or less the standard classes and races from *Dungeons and Dragons* Fifth Edition. It features classical dungeon delves and monster hunts as well as political intrigue, lost ruins, and ancient magics.

The Duchy of the Sapphire Coast is a remote region, far from the heart of the kingdom but rich in natural resources. Its capital city is Jewel, a small city compared to the heartlands, but prosperous. The region is ruled by the Duchess Harrington.

## Geography

The Sapphire Coast can be divided up into five regions. The heart of the Sapphire Coast is the Vale of Jewel and [the City]({{site.baseurl}}/settings/sapphire-coast/locations/city-of-jewel) of the same name. The other four regions surround Jewel: the hills to the west, the woods to the south, the shores to the east, and the plains to the north.

From the foothills of the [Giant's Wall mountains](#) to the shores of the [Sea of Storms](#), the Sapphire Coast is roughly a hundred miles east to west, with the city of Jewel more or less in the center where the Lesser and Greater Lapis rivers merge. Likewise, between the transition from plains to desert in the north, and the point of no return in the southern forest is approximately a hundred miles, with Jewel again more or less in the center.

### The Vale of Jewel

Temperate and fertile, the Vale of Jewel is both the geographic and the cultural heart of the Sapphire Coast. With rich soil fed by abundant rainfall, the fields and farming villages surrounding the city produce wagonloads of grain and vegetables to send to the markets of Amaranth.

The Greater and Lesser Lapis rivers flow into the vale from the west and the south, respectively, merging at the city of Jewel. From there the Lapis flows east down to the sea. It is navigable by smaller vessels as far inland as Jewel.

### The Western Hills

The western hills march down from the foothills of the [Giant's Wall](#) mountains to the edge of the Vale of Jewel. Rocky and uneven, with large stands of trees that turn to evergreens as the altitude rises. The Greater Lapis river flows down from the mountains toward Jewel, but the frequent rapids and cataracts make navigating the river impossible for vessels of any size.

There are a number of smaller towns and villages here, clustered near the trade road that leads to [Fire Serpent Pass](#) and Amaranth. The primary occupation in the high foothills is mining, with rich veins of iron and occasional traces of precious metals. The ground in the lower hills is too rocky for farming, but abundant rainfall makes for abundant forage for herd animals, and some of the older settlements have cultivated orchards of fruit trees.

Travelers who stray too far from the trade road have reported goblins, monsters, and worse out in the wilderness. Most towns and villages have militias for their own protection, as the Ducal Guard lacks the manpower to patrol in force outside the Vale.

### The Eastern Shores

The eastern shore of the Sapphire Coast borders on the aptly-named [Sea of Storms](#). Although the coast stretches for many miles to the north and south, most of the population of the east is concentrated along the Lapis river as it flows east from Jewel. The [port town of Facet](#) lies at the river's mouth, where the nearby reefs and the island of [Land's End](#) provide some shelter from the yearly storms.

Towns and villages on the banks of the Lapis are much like those in the Vale of Jewel, with a decidedly independent spirit and built to resist the storm winds. On the coast, the Sea of Storms provides rich fisheries, as well as beds of shellfish and abalone. The occasional trading ship will weigh anchor in Opal as well, usually with a cargo of spices from the south.

The long miles of shoreline north and south of the Lapis are largely uninhabited. Fishermen and sailors tell stories of monsters of all sizes and descriptions, and there are persistent rumors of entire cities of sea serpents out in the deep waters.

### The Southern Woods

The south of the Sapphire Coast is covered in old-growth forest. The Lesser Lapis river flows north to Jewel, carrying with it vast quantities of cut lumber destined for sale in Amaranth or to fuel the growth of the local towns and cities. There are a number of smaller towns and villages closer to the Vale, but the deep woods are all but uninhabited save for the logging camps. Stories tell of wandering rangers, hidden elven groves, or entire druidic circles concealed in the underbrush.

Most people in this part of the Sapphire Coast live close to the Vale, where game is still plentiful but monsters rare. Hunting for deer and rabbit are common, and the southern villages contribute some of the best archers to the Ducal Guard. Farther south, the logging camps harvest rare and valuable lumber, but require constant guard from attacks by disturbed wildlife or worse.

While the near reaches have been largely pacified by a combination of the Ducal Guard, local adventurers and village militias, the deep woods are known to be full of monsters of every description. Only the foolish travel as far south as the logging camps alone or unarmed, and of those that have tried to venture farther do not return.

### The Northern Plains

The northern plains of the Sapphire Coast are rocky and arid, with only the yearly storms providing much rainfall. Close to the Vale a few hardy souls eke out a living from the land, but farther north is a desert in all but name. This part of the Sapphire Coast produces little of note, and the few people who live here tend to shun company.

## History

The Sapphire Coast was once populated by wild elementals, although they have not been seen since the land was settled.

The Sapphire Coast was settled a hundred years ago, but there are ruins from much older civilizations scattered around. The current Duchess is Grace Harrington, a retired paladin and adventurer.
