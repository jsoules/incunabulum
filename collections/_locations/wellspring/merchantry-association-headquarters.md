The headquarters of the [Merchantry Association]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations/merchantry-association) lies at the heart of the Civic District. While the formal headquarters is a large building of vaulted stone, much of the business is conducted in the surrounding offices. Having a dedicated space within the Association building itself is a mark of considerable wealth and prestige.
