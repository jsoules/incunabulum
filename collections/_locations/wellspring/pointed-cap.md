The unofficial apprentice hangout for the Arcane Order, the Pointed Cap was originally a working class bar called the Bent Horseshoe. After it was gutted in the Sherem Wars, it was rebuilt by its current proprietor, a tiefling who goes by the name Pierre. The Pointed Cap is infamous for its varied cocktail menu, featuring spirits Pierre claims are actually infernal in origin. The building is also strongly warded to suppress spellcasting, officially to prevent student shenanigans, which makes it a useful neutral ground for some otherwise-hostile parties.
