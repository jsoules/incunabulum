Before the Sherem Wars, the *Last Stop* was an adventurer's inn and tavern. Since the discovery of magicite the old inn has become the heart of the headquarters of the [Delver's Guild]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/organizations/delvers-guild). It is widely rumored that the *Last Stop's* basement has an entrance to one of the safer areas beneath Wellspring, and the tavern is the traditional starting point for a novice adventuring group's first delve.
