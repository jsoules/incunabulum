The headquarters of the [Arcane Order]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations/arcane-order) is a grand edifice of marble, with a fortified tower jutting out over the edge of the Great Chasm. In addition to the great library, it holds the offices of the guildâ€™s leadership, laboratories of the arcane arts, and (it is claimed) vaults filled with powerful enchanted artifacts.
