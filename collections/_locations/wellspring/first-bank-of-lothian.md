The First Bank of Lothian is by far the largest single commercial institution with an interest in Wellspring. It provides services for changing and lending money, albeit almost exclusively to the well-to-do of the city. The bank has invested large sums into the rebuilding and expansion of Wellspring, and is said to own large portions of the Upper City.
