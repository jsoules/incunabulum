The headquarters of the [City Guard]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations/city-guard) is located in the Civic District, although most of the guards barracks and armories are located in the Lower City, closer to the Great Chasm. The sprawling complex also serves as the city’s administrative hub and the meeting place of the city’s ruling council, although there are talks of building a dedicated hall for that purpose.
