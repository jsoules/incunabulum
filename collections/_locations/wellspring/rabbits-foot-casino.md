An ostentatious (some would say gaudy) complex at the edge of the Noble’s Quarter, the Rabbit’s Foot Casino is *the* place for the wealthy and powerful of Wellspring to see and be seen, or so claims the well-funded gossip mill. Despite (or perhaps because of) persistent rumors of ties to the Harfoot Syndicate, the Rabbit’s Foot makes a point of distinguishing itself from the somewhat sleazy dens of gambling and vice found in the lower districts. The casino proudly boasts the finest imported spirits, games of chance and excitement, and an army of attractive staff of all forms and persuasions to keep the party (and the money) flowing.
