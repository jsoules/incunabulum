When completed, the Cathedral of Radiance will be a towering symbol of the [Church of Light]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations/church-of-light) and its growing power in Lothian. For now, the cathedral is little more than a foundation, although extensive work has been done in building out the catacombs beneath. Also under construction (and nearly completed) on the cathedral grounds is a chapterhouse of the [Knights of the Dawn]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations/knights-of-the-dawn), an order of paladins closely associated with the Church of Light.
