One of the newest of the “noble” houses of the city, House Savindar was founded by a retired adventurer, [Dame Luciana Savindar]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/characters/dame-savindar), who leveraged her fortune and connections to become a fixture in the city’s social and political scene. Dame Savindar is a founder and major patron of the Delver’s Guild, and is frequently found in the broadsheets, usually under “Scandals”.
