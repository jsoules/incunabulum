A space set aside for the community and the arts, the Silverstone Theater was endowed by retired adventurer [Vistra Silverstone]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/characters/vistra-silverstone). It currently houses a plucky but struggling community theater program, but its location at the edge of the Old City (and near the expanding Garden District) makes its future uncertain.
