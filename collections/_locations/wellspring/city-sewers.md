A marvel of engineering, the sewers carry the city’s wastes deep into the mountains. About once a generation, some clever wit suggests avoiding the need for constant maintenance by dumping the city’s refuse into the Chasm. The resulting surge in monster attacks (not to mention the stench) makes such policies short-lived.

Despite the merchantry’s howls about extortionate taxation, the sewers are actively maintained and repaired by an army of city workers, and occasionally patrolled by whatever City Guard have managed to thoroughly annoy their superiors. Occasional outbreaks of magical fungus, gatherings of ravenous rat-men, or particularly disgusting cults can be driven out by adventurers.
