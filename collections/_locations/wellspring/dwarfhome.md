A fortified community populated largely by dwarves. Wealthy and prosperous, this district would not be out of place in the upper city. Instead, it lies at a middle depth into the Undercity at the terminus of the Underroad, a wide tunnel of smooth stone that leads north to the Dwarvish city of Silverhold, deep beneath the mountains.

Because of its location beneath the city, Dwarfhome faces regular attack from monsters from the Great Chasm and creatures that have dug their way into the Underroad, as well as the usual dangers of the Undercity. As such, it maintains its own force of guardians, [the Stonewardens]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/organizations/stonewardens).
