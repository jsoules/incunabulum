The Old Saw Inn is a rustic-looking cluster of buildings at the edge of the Bronzewood, all rough-cut logs and natural stones. It is a common stopping point for travellers as well as those who work in the forest - hunters, trappers, and woodcutters, as well as the occasional wood elf. The current proprietors are a pair of humans named Mika and Michel, who despite their similar appearance insist they are not twins.

The Old Saw is about a day's travel from Wellspring.
