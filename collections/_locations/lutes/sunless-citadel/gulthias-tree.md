The Gulthias Tree once stood in a corrupted grove at the heart of the Sunless Citadel. Grown from a stake used to slay a master vampire, it retained much of the vampires corruptive nature. Belak the mad druid attempted to channel this necrotic energy, creating the twig blights that now infest the wilds of the Sapphire Coast.
