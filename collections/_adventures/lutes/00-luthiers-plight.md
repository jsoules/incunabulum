While wandering the countryside, Aoife receives a letter from her old friend Thea Garrick, a luthier of some renown who lives in the city of Jewel in the Sapphire Coast. According to the letter, Garrick has completed working on her masterpiece, a lute of surpassing quality, and wants Aoife to be the first one to play it.

Aoife travels to the city of Jewel, only to discover ominous stirrings afoot in the Sapphire Coast. Shortly before reaching the city, she encounters a farmer trapped on his wagon by a pair of strange tree creatures. Fortunately, the malevolent foliage fell quickly to her steel, but the farmer's horse had since been dragged off into the nearby stand of trees.

Upon her arrival in Jewel, Aoife discovered more bad news - Garrick the luthier was missing, and her shop had been robbed. The corrupt City Watch were of no use, so she resolved to investigate the matter herself. At the Cup and Lizard tavern, she heard that others were going missing and their homes or workplaces destroyed. She also picked up some political gossip, finding that the new Duchess was well regarded with the common folk of Jewel. Taking a closer look at the scene of the crime, Aoife found that shiny metal objects had been stolen while other objects of value had been left behind, and that the intruders had seemingly entered the workshop from the city's sewers.

Investigating the disturbances down in the Docks district, Aoife made an unlikely ally - a member of the Thieves' Guild known as Jack. Several members of the Thieves' Guild had also gone missing, and Jack agreed to join forces with Aoife in her search. Together they ventured into the sewers, finding a warren of tunnels and chambers marked with rat's head insigniae. They also battled an animate skeleton and a nest of giant rats before returning to the surface.

Delving into the sewers of Jewel once more, Aoife and Jack track the kidnapped victims to an underground band of goblins with painted rat's head emblems. Aoife and Jack met the goblins with steel and magic, Aoife lulling several into an enchanted slumber while the rest advanced with spears, sickles, and giant rat pets.

The guards dispatched, Aoife and Jack continued to the goblins' lair, a filthy warren filled with stolen goods and an ominous cookpot. Together they defeated the local goblin boss and drove the goblin band from the city, fortunately in time to rescue a very nervous Garrick and several others from the cookpot. Unfortunately, the masterwork lute had already been sent as tribute on to the mysterious Goblin King, somewhere in the hills.

Worried that the skills of a wandering bard may not be sufficient to recover the stolen lute, Aoife prevailed upon Jack to teach her some of the tricks of the Thieves' Guild.
