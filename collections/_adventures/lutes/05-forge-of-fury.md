Aoife received a letter from "Granny" Audhild of Glitter Gulch.

> Aoife,
>
> I hope this letter finds you well, my comrade in arms. Unfortunately, I do not
> only write to express my congratulations. Something is terribly wrong here in
> Glitter Gulch - there is a foulness in the air, and the water no longer runs
> clean. Since fighting along side you this summer I've dusted off some of my
> old kit, but I'm not as young as I used to be and I could use some help
> getting to the source of all this nonsense.
>
> Maybe you can introduce me to that Lily of yours, too.
>
> Your Stalwart Ally,
>
> Audhild Jorunnsdottir

With the scholar Taliesan still researching the library of the Druids, Aoife decides to set out at first light to assist her former comrade.

Aoife, Lily, and Aurora set out for Glitter Gulch.

> Date: [2 Manticore]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/lutes/adventures#winter-2258)

With winter closing on the Sapphire Coast, Aoife, Lily and Aurora arrived in Glitter Gulch. As Audhild had warned, there was a chemical stink in the air, and a vile rainbow film on the streams leading down out of the highlands. Meeting up with the grim-faced cleric, the party made preparations for a trip into the mountains.

> Date: [3 Manticore]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/lutes/adventures#winter-2258)

The three adventurers and intrepid dragon began to make their way up into the foothills. They were soon confronted by a trio of angry earth elementals; fortunately, Aoife's clever tongue calmed the elementals, who proclaimed that the speaker could pass. Asked questions about the magic running wild, the elementals said only that the druids maintained the magic of the Sapphire Coast, and that "soon, we will all awaken".

They continued further uphill, running across a group of trappers, one Tomas and his three cousins. Tomas lamented that there used to be abundant creatures to trap and hunt, but the befouled water had killed or driven many of them away, along with monsters being driven down from the high mountains. One of the cousins claimed that he had been chased by giant wolves, and that a giant man had led them. They also reported seeing columns or chimneys spouting vile smoke farther up the trail. Grateful for the information, Aoife lent her healing magic to restore a frozen leg, and suggested the four take shelter in the town.

As the party continues up the mountain, a caustic rain began to fall, further denuding the landscape and threatening the health of the travelers. Aoife and company quickly located a cave to shelter in, but found a light shining somewhere deeper inside. Aoife investigated, finding a cyclops tending a bubbling cookpot along with four giant wolves. Unfortunately, while she attempted to sneak back out Aoife steps on a discarded bone. She tried to hide using her *invisibility* magic but was sniffed out by the giant wolves. Throwing a fire spell to cover her escape, she fled back to Audhild and Lily.

Audhild attempted to use her mastery of the giantish tongue to order the wolves to stand down, at which the cyclops commanded the wolves to kill and bring him their dinners. At that, the cleric conjured a phalanx of ancestral warriors. The party resisted the wolves' charge, allowing Aurora to leap over and freeze three of the wolves with her draconic breath. Aoife finished the wolves with another burst of flame, while Lily tried to strike at the cyclops with her magic to little effect. Audhild managed to catch the cyclops in the eye with a well-aimed crossbow bolt, blinding him; he retaliated with a wildly-thrown boulder before lumbering forward with his tree trunk-sized club. Audhild brought down the last wolf before taking a running leap through the cyclop's wild swings to strike him square in the chest with her warhammer. As he faltered, Aoife delivered the killing blow with a bolt of lightning.

With the acid rain continuing unabated, the party investigated the cookfire. After Audhild found poisonous mushrooms floating in the stew, they decided to stick to their own rations, and retired for the evening.

> Date: [4 Manticore]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/lutes/adventures#winter-2258)

The acid rain ended overnight, leaving unsettling-looking pools here and there on the valley floor. The party followed the trail farther up into the mountains, and came across a large clearing with several once-natural chimneys now belching a foul black-green smoke. Here and there, vile liquids were bubbling up from rifts in the corrupted earth. Warily, Aoife and Lily used their *invisibility* spells to investigate the clearing, and found an abandoned worksite that had been ravaged by neglect and the corrosive rain.

As they approached the center of the clearing, an enormous earth elemental rose up from the ground, dripping with pollution and with rusted debris trapped in its form. Unlike its lesser kindred earlier in the journey, the rocky titan was clearly maddened with pain, and attacked the intruders who disturbed its uneasy slumber.

With the elemental blameless for its plight, Audhild asked for the intercession of her pantheon. The gods answered, inspiring the cleric with a ritual of forging and purification. While dodging thrown boulders and mighty swings of the elemental's stony fists, Aoife and Lily applied their fire magic to melt the debris trapped in the elemental's form and boil off the poison, with Aurora's icy breath serving to both embrittle and quench the creature. With a throw of her might hammer, Audhild shattered the outer layer of the elemental, revealing a pulsing core of corruption. Another fireball and bolt of lightning left the titan stunned, and a final blow from Audhild's hammer destroyed the foul poison once and for all.

The elemental crumbled, and for a moment the party feared it had not survived the purification. To their relief, it soon re-rose, free of the festering corruption that had so maddened it. The grateful elder elemental answered Aoife's queries in its rumbling dialect of Primordial. Like its smaller kindred, it warned that the awakening was coming. The immediate crisis, however, was caused by a band of dwarves, "now below". Audhild recalled that a long-abandoned dwarvish holdfast was nearby. However, this kind of environmental devastation was anathema to right-minded dwarves, and she warned that those responsible could be capable of anything.

After a rest, the party head toward the entrance of the old outpost, built into a nearby peak called the Stone Tooth for its exposed stone crown. However, they discover that upper levels of the holdfast have been occupied by a clan of ogres, the Shattered Skull. The ogres are suspicious but not immediately hostile, and Aoife (using Audhild as a translator) convinces the sentries that the party only wants passage down to fight the dwarves, a common enemy. The ogrish sentries (a pair named Wark and Thark) tell the party that a group of dwarves recently moved into the old forges deep below, and many ogres were lost trying to drive them out and take their steel.

With immediate hostilities averted, Wark sent Thark to get "the Horned One". Aoife played her pipe to pass the time, while Audhild asked the ogrish sentries about their situation. While Wark would not discuss their numbers with outsiders, she mentioned that clean water was accessible from springs within the mountain, but that food was becoming a problem - hunting was sparse, and trolls had slaughtered their herd of goats.

The discussion was interrupted by the arrival of what could only be "the Horned One", an enormous ogre with great curving horns, steel-grey skin and elongated teeth. He proclaimed himself the Great Ulfe, leader of the Shattered Skull, and declared that the party was trespassing on his mountain. Ulfe acknowledged that the dwarves below were a shared enemy, but before the party were allowed to pass into the mountain, they would have to prove themselves to the ogres. Specifically, by killing the trolls that had slaughtered their goats and were driving away what little game survived the pollution. Not wanting to face an entire clan of ogres, the party agreed. Ulfe warned that if they failed, it was into the cookpot for them: "Either way, ogres will eat."

Following the directions given by the Great Ulfe, the party departed north from the road at the foot of the Stone Tooth. They quickly found the clearing where the goats had been kept; an enormous paddock of wood and stone, now with several great holes torn in its walls and scattered with bits of fur and broken goat horns. Investigating, Aoife found several sets of enormous footprints, leading higher up into the hills. With the heavily armored Audhild ill-suited to the party's normal stealth tactics, Aoife and Lily instead decided to set a trap, with the cleric serving as bait.

The party thus followed the trail to a cleft in the rock that looked (and smelled) like a troll's hideaway. Keen-eyed Aoife spotted one troll hiding at the mouth of the cave, and another lurking in ambush behind nearby trees, visibly dripping venom. Before the trolls could spring their own trap, she flushed out the closer troll with a fan of flames from her *burning hands*, scorching its hide. The other troll emerged from the cave, likewise dripping with corruption and with an enormous left arm that looked half again too large for its body. It lunged at Audhild and dealt her a powerful blow even through the cleric's steel armor.

Enraged, the troll Aoife burned lunged at her and deliberately tore its own wound open, spraying her with its toxic blood, while Lily struck it with series of fiery blasts. Audhild called upon her pantheon to wrap her hammer in a fiery nimbus, narrowly missing the troll with a mighty blow. Aoife carefully dodged back from her opponent and struck it with another fan of flames, wounding it badly and allowing Aurora to drop in behind it to strike with teeth and tail. Barely alive and still smouldering, the troll attempted to flee but was taken down with a swipe of Aurora's claws.

The remaining troll struck Audhild again with a lucky blow from its claws. The cleric retaliated with a powerful hammer strike, triggering the fiery aura and setting the monstrous beast alight. She recast the searing spell as the troll staggered back, allowing Lily to strike it with another series of scorching spells. Aurora launched into the air once more and swooped down on the troll with her bite and swing of her tail, dealing a pair of vicious blows but dousing both her and Audhild with more of the troll's poisonous blood; enraged, the troll turned on the dragon and attacked with teeth and claws. Now badly wounded, Aurora evaded back into the air, allowing both Aoife and Lily to bombard the troll with fiery spells. The troll attempted to retreat, but Aoife pursued and struck the monster down with a final fan of flames.

Battered by the difficult battle and with the sun setting behind the mountains, the party retreated a short distance into the hills and made camp for the night.
