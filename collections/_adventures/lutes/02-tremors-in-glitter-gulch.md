The Summer Solstice.

As Aoife and Lily returned from Oakhurst, the very earth of the Sunless Citadel seemed to rise up in revolt. The ground quaked, ash clouds rose above the Giant's Wall mountains, and an ominous red glow lit the western sky at night. Pulled in two directions, the group decided to split their attention - Lily will continue on to Jewel and continue tracking the lost lute, while Aoife and the newly named Aurora will investigate the fires on the horizon.

While traveling into the foothills of the Giant's Wall mountains, Aoife made camp and is attacked during the night by a swarm of twig blights. Fortunately, she made quick work of the fiends with the help of Aurora's icy breath.

As the sun is setting behind the mountains, Aoife approached the base of Fire Serpent Pass. The volcanos on either side were visibly in full eruption, and the ground periodically trembled. Across the valley floor was the start of the pass and the small town and trading post of Glitter Gulch; unfortunately, the valley was crawling with fire snakes. Aoife and Aurora make a mad dash across to reach the town, only to find that she is now trapped - the fire snakes attack anything moving in the valley, and the trade pass above is blocked by debris and molten rock.

Glitter Gulch itself has been hit hard by the eruption, with fire snakes emerging under outlying buildings and an entire dwarvish trade caravan trapped in the town square. With tempers running high and rations running low, Aoife receives a cold welcome from the head of the local militia. Resolved to do what she can to assist, Aoife spends some time playing her lute for the gathered refugees before she and Aurora make camp for the night.

The following morning, Aoife found that Aurora had made a game of hunting fire snakes down in the valley, which had considerably endeared the dragon to the suspicious folk of Glitter Gulch. Unfortunately, she also discovered that a party of miners is still unaccounted for, and that the militia members sent to look for them haven't returned. She tried to enlist the dwarvan caravaneers without success before encountering "Granny" Audhild, retired adventurer and unofficial town cook. Grouchy but good-hearted, Audhild agreed to help Aoife search for the missing miners. Together with the curious dragon, the two descend into the mines.

The mines seemed to have been abandoned in haste, with Aoife and Audhild spotting discarded tools and derailed mine carts, along with an occasional tunnel melted into the solid rock by fire snakes. The pair soon find the body of one of the missing militia guards, burned spear still clutched in her hand. There are more fire snake tunnels here, and discarded mining tools with scorch marks and melted tips.

A partial collapse caused Aoife and Audhild to detour through the natural caverns surrounding the mine. The pair saw an uncanny violet light ahead, and found a chamber half-filled with glowing mushrooms, now scorched and scattered by more fire snake tunnels. The fungal denizens turned out to be carnivorous, and several of the larger specimens attacked with rotting magics. The violet fungi were easily defeated; unfortunately not before several of the missing miners had fallen victim to them.

Seeing a shimmering orange light in the tunnels ahead, Aurora suddenly raced forward. Aoife and Audhild pursued, finding a deep rift in the stone, an ominous red glow glimmering far below. A lone natural bridge crossed the chasm, around which three fire mephits were chasing Aurora. The pair leapt into battle to rescue the dragon and found the mephits to be tough opponents - the mischievous elementals were fast and agile, and exploded in a burst of fire once they were finally brought down. Mindful of the dangers to the still-missing miners, the group paused here to recover their strength.

The half-elf, dwarf, and dragon continued deeper into the caves and found at last another sign of life - the second militia member, seemingly on death's door but steadfastly guarding a narrow passage. Aoife and Audhild rushed to offer their respective healing magic, and the guard explained that he had held off a fire snake while the surviving miners fled through the passage behind him. It lead to some sort of old tomb, whose magics protected it from the burrowing elementals.

Following the passage, Aoife and Audhild emerged into an ornate hallway, elaborately carved with mosaics depicting dwarven battles, demonic summonings, and dark rituals. The canny old cleric recognized it as a tomb of the Cult of the Dragon, a forbidden dwarven sect that revered a great entity said to sleep in the root of the mountains. From the iconography, the entity was described both as a terrible dragon and as a formless shadow.

Continuing into the tombs, Aoife and Audhild found the missing miners - unfortunately, they have fallen victim to a pit trap, which has covered itself with an iron grate. While their injuries are minor, they cannot reach the mechanism to reset the trap and escape. At the end of the hall past the trap was an elaborate archway, leading to an antechamber with a pair of twin suits of empty dwarvish armor seemingly standing guard by a pair of stone doors. A side chamber held what could only be a crypt, with a half dozen burial niches holding deceased dwarves in cult regalia. In between, free-standing torches burned with a cold, eerie blue flame.

As Aoife feared, as soon as the party entered the crypt the same blue flame erupted in empty eye sockets, and the six dwarves arose to battle the intruders who disturbed their rest. Audhild's holy magic was a powerful boon against their undead adversaries, while Aoife relied on her fire magics and Aurora on her teeth and claws. Victorious, Aoife found a  key forged from some dark alloy of iron around the necklace of one of the dwarves.

Seeing no other path forward, Aoife and Audhild stepped through the archway. Immediately, the torches on the walls and the helmets of the waiting armors erupted in blue flame, and the armors hefted weapons and advanced toward the intruders. Faced with foes in close quarters, Aoife retreated behind Audhild's mighty hammer, darting forward to strike swift blows with her rapier and then retreating. She used the dark iron key to unlock the stone doors, opening the path to the tomb's inner sanctum.

Here, another dwarf lay in repose, still garbed in plate armor of the same dark iron. The group made final preparations before stepping into the mausoleum to face this new foe, who as expected rose from its bier at their approach, eyes burning a cold blue. The battle was hard fought, aided by Aurora who used her icy breath to shatter the dwarf's tough armor. Investigating the mausoleum afterward, Aoife found a *belt of dwarvenkind*, along with the mechanism to reset the pit trapping the miners. Watching carefully for more fire snakes, the party and the rescued miners returned to the surface and Glitter Gulch.

The following morning, the militia had put together a plan to get the caravan through the contested valley. Nackle, a local alchemist of some reknown and questionable sanity, had brewed up an enormous batch of *instant frost*, which volunteers would pour into the fire snake holes. While the elementals are hopefully distracted, the caravan would make a mad rush for the far end of the valley. Aoife and Aurora offered to serve as escorts, while Granny Audhild decided to assist the militia in their task.

The *instant frost* worked almost too well, as it drew a full salamander out of hiding, the fire naga attacking the caravan with magic and glowing-hot steel. Between the borrowed alchemy and Aurora's freezing breath, however, the salamander was driven off; with Aoife providing a hasty *mending* for a broken wagon wheel, the caravan escaped the valley and began its journey back to Jewel. Aoife decided to remain with the caravan, learning that they were transporting raw materials to Amaranth on behalf of the Deepstone Trading Company. The dwarven caravaneers invite Aoife to meet with the head of the company when she returns to Jewel.

On returning to Jewel with the caravan, Aoife met with the head of the Deepstone Trading Company, one Madame Torgga. She thanked Aoife for rescuing her caravan, and offered to exchange the *belt of dwarvenkind* with a *bag of holding*, which Aoife gladly accepted.
