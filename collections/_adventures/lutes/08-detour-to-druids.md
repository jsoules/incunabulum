  Far to the south of the Sapphire Coast, Aoife and Lily reunited with Biren the ranger to uncover a festering corruption growing in the forest. Along with a hidden elven village and Ironhide the gnomish Druid, they battled and destroyed a tainted treant in an old druidic grove. Afterward, Ironhide told them some of the history of the Sapphire Coast, and of the four Elemental Temples said to contain the region's awesome power.
