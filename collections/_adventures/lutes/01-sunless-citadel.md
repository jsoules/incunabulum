  Aoife and her new friend Lily accompany the ranger Biren into the depths of a ruined fortress, inhabited by warring bands of kobolds and goblins. Aoife briefly recovers the lost lute, but loses it again to goblin treachery. Deep beneath the Citadel they battle the mad druid Belak, who warns that the elementals will scour clean the land.
