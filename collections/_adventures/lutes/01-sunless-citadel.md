Aoife leaves Jewel for the town of Oakhurst, famed for its music festival celebrating the summer solstice. At a tavern midway through the journey, she hears a storyteller recite the tale of the Sunless Citadel, a ruined fortress ruled by the cruel Goblin King and the home of mysterious dark creatures.

Aoife also encounters Lily, a private investigator with flame-red hair who is searching for the source of the mysterious tree creatures that have previously attacked Aoife outside of Jewel. The two agree to combine forces, and Aoife joins Lily in her rented carriage for the remainder of the journey.

> Date: [9 Phoenix]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/lutes/adventures#spring-2258)

Aoife and Lily arrive in Oakhurst, with many visitors already gathered for the festival. Rumors tell of goblin raids and auctions of strange magical fruit, as well as complaints of stolen cattle vanished into the brush. The pair also made the acquaintance of Biren, a half-elven ranger with a wolf companion and limited patience for civilization; he makes the trip every year to the music festical.

> Date: [10 Phoenix]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/lutes/adventures#spring-2258)

Aoife and Lily ask questions around town regarding the Sunless Citadel. Garon, the barkeep of the Ol' Boar Inn, has heard stories of the place, but believes most of them to be wild exaggerations. He recalls that a paladin was asking questions about the Citadel about a month ago; before that, the last person to take much interest was a very odd man with a giant frog, some twelve years back.

Meanwhile, the proprietor of the general store, one Madame Hucrele, asks Aoife and Lily to find her missing adult son and daughter Talgen and Sharwyn, who formed an adventuring party with a ranger and a visiting paladin and left for the Sunless Citadel a month prior. Aoife, Lily, and Biren agree to investigate the citadel together, and set out for it that afternoon. Making camp in the hills, they are attacked by a swarm of blights, including several that fire razor-sharp needles.

> Date: [11 Phoenix]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/lutes/adventures#spring-2258)

Aoife, Lily, and Biren arrive at the edge of a great chasm in the hills, lined with old fire pits and leaning or fallen pillars. A rope still hanging from one pillar gave access to the chasm, terminating at a crumbling staircase that lead down into the depths. While descending, they were attacked by giant wolf spiders, but managed to drive them off.

At the base of the stairs was the Sunless Citadel itself, a great stone ruin in permanent shadow from the ravine. A field of treacherous debris surrounded the ruins, save for a narrow path from the stairs to a single crumbling tower ahead. Entering the tower, the party narrowly avoided a trapdoor before encountering and destroying a trio of animated skeletons, where they discovered a handful of magic arrows.

When the party continued further into the ruins, they met with the kobold Meepo, a would-be dragon keeper. The kobolds had captured a white dragon wyrmling they named Calcryx ("frost" in Draconic), and planned to use it as a secret weapon in their war against the goblins deeper in the ruins. However, the goblins struck first and stole the dragon away. While not welcoming of outsiders, the kobolds are in a precarious situation, and Meepo agrees to take Aoife, Lily and Biren to negotiate with the kobold leadership. The party is escorted through kobold territory to meet with the clan's leader, the sorceress Yusdrayl.

Yusdrayl is a kobold with a white gown, striking red scales, and a healthy distrust of outsiders, whom she refers to indiscriminately as "tall folk". Her price for safe passage deeper into the ruins is to drive out the goblins, with whom the kobolds have been at war for some months. She also offers a reward if the party can recover the stolen dragon alive. On further discussion, Yusdrayl mentions the missing adventuring party with some anger; they had come to the citadel a month prior and slew several of her clan. One died when fighting the giant spiders infesting the chasm, while the remaining three fought on into the goblins' territory.

At the conclusion of negotiations, Meepo escorted the party to the edge of kobold territory. From there, the party continued deeper into the ruins, passing several dry fountains and battling another trio of giant wolf spiders. Continuing on, they found themselves in the lair of the giant spider matriarch, battling the massive arachnid and four of her children. The battle was closely fought, but the party emerged victorious, finding a small hoard of treasures and the remains of the ranger Karakas.

Wounded and wearied, Aoife, Lily and Biren found and fortified an empty chamber to make camp for the night.

> Date: [12 Phoenix]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/lutes/adventures#spring-2258)

As dawn rose on the surface, Aoife, Lily and Biren continued their expedition, striking for the first time into goblin territory. They freed a small stockade of prisoners, including three kobolds and the gnome Irky Timbers, who offered the party healing in gratitude for the rescue. Irky had also picked up some secrets from the goblins during her captivity. Apparently, the goblins were led by a human named Belak, a druid with a frog companion. Belak forced the goblins to cultivate the twig blights and to sell magical apples to the townsfolk, further spreading the blight via their seeds.

Disturbed, the party ventured deeper into the ruined citadel. They battled more goblin guards outside of a destroyed chapel, while allowing the noncombatants within to flee. Continuing, they found the chamber where the stolen dragon Calcryx had been taken; the wyrmling had escaped from her bonds and fortified herself amidst the ruined furniture. Aoife attempted to coax out the dragon without success, although she started to develop a bond with the wyrmling. Reluctantly, she continued on.

At the heart of goblin territory was the throne room of Chief Durnn, a hobgoblin who had usurped the goblin tribe and allied with the druid Belak. A deep well lead down into the depths beneath the Citadel, while Durnn and his hobgoblin guards held court and watched the tribe's treasure. Durnn was uninterested in negotiation, demanding the party's surrender to be handed over to the mad druid's tender mercies. A difficult battle erupted, but Aoife, Lily and Biren were victorious, slaying Durnn and his hobgoblin bullies.

From there, the goblin shaman Grenl asked for parley. With many of the tribe's warriors slain, they could no longer hope for victory against the invading kobolds, and agreed to leave the citadel and seek their fortunes elsewhere. She traded the stolen lute to Aoife in exchange for the magical arrows discovered earlier, and gave Lily the signet ring of Talgen Hucrele.

With the goblins defeated, the party descended the well into the depths beneath the citadel, finding themselves in a series of natural caverns overgrown with blights and strange, twisted greenery. They battled a half-dozen blights, as well as a pair of animate skeletons that seemed to have been cultivating the foul creatures. Aoife, Lily and Biren then ran afoul of Belak's gardener, a foul-tempered bugbear with a pair of giant badgers.

Venturing deeper into the caverns, the party found twisted laboratories where Belak or his minons performed foul experiments. One such chamber held the corpse of a giant rat that had nearly been consumed by woody, tumorous growths, still tied to an examination table. Aoife took some samples of the experimental elixirs before continuing on.

After another battle with a fiery serpent, the party elected to fall back and lick their wounds.

> Date: [13 Phoenix]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/lutes/adventures#spring-2258)

As promised, the goblins had departed the Citadel overnight - but treacherously, stole both Garrick's lost lute and Aoife's own, after the bard left both for safekeeping in the goblins' own strongbox. Torn between pursuing the thieves and continuing their task, the party elected to finish their exploration and confront the mad druid Belak.

The journey was difficult, and Aoife, Lily and Biren battled waves of twig and needle blights as well as their skeleton caretakers before finally reaching the heart of the Sunless Citadel, a large cavern dominated by a great withered tree.

Here waited Belak, with Sharwyn Hucrele and the paladin Sir Bradford enthralled at his side. Here, the mad druid explained, stood the great Gulthias Tree. Living, though it looked dead, the tree was grown from a stake that slew a master vampire. The tree was the source of the blights, as well as the magical fruit the goblins once traded with Oakhurst. A powerful source of necromantic energy, Belak sought to use that power to create a sanctuary against the return of the elementals that once controlled the Sapphire Coast.

Even if his intentions were just - and Aoife and Lily were uncertain - Belaks actions were responsible for spreading the twig blight across the Sapphire Coast. The druid was unwilling to surrender, and declared that he would use the Gulthias Tree to convert the interlopers into wooden guardians for him, as he previously had with the paladin and wizard that now stood at his side. The battle was hard-fought, but between Aoife's music and magic, Lily's blade and Biren's bow the druid and his tree-thralls were struck down, and the foul Gulthias Tree set ablaze.

Before exiting the citadel, however, Aoife had one more piece of business. Returning to the white dragon wyrmling's impromptu lair, she built on the bond she had established and convinced the dragon to accompany them. She named the dragon Aurora.

With Belak's mad plan foiled and the missing adventurers found, the party returned to town to catch the tail end of the midsummer festival. In Oakhurst, Biren parted ways with Aoife and Lily, preferring a more solitary (and dragon-free life in the wilds) of the Sapphire Coast. Aoife and Lily spend some of their collected treasure on adventuring gear. To Aoife's fury, she was forced to purchase back her own lute. She did receive a clue as to the fate of Garrick's materwork - it had already been purchased by a very rude merchant from Jewel, apparently as a gift for his daughter.

> Date: [14 Phoenix]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/lutes/adventures#spring-2258)

Aoife and Lily are awakened at dawn to a clamor outside, as the town's militia hastily attempts to drive off an "attacking" white dragon. Aoife is able to calm the dragon, but is very politely asked to leave Oakhurst and not return with the magical flying apex predator. Having avoided attention, Lily purchases a wagon large enough to hide Aurora, and the new trio set off east toward Jewel, on the trail of the stolen lute once more.
