<!-- @todo: Taliesin arrives in the Sapphire Coast, questions Aoife and Lily about their adventures. -->

<!-- @todo: The wreck of the Sky Dancer. Arrival of Dean Artemisia and her expedition. -->

<!-- > Date: Day 0 -->

Unsettled by the revelations of Ironhide the Druid, Aoife and Lily make the journey back to Jewel, where the discover the expedition to the Lost Library preparing to depart. Taliesan has decoded the final clues to finding the library, a discovery for which Artemisia was quick to claim credit. Assisted by a small team of local guards and porters, the caravan set out to the north.

<!-- Date: Day 2 -->

On the second day of travel, as the land turned from scrubland to rough hills and arid valleys, Aoife spotted movement ahead as the caravan approached a gully between two steep hills. She alerted Darvin and the guards; unfortunately, there was no way around the hills without long hours of travel over rough terrain. Aoife, Lily and Aurora volunteered to scout ahead. Choosing to stick to the sheer cliffs for better cover, Aoife took a minor injury from a fall before reaching a crown of stunted trees that surrounded the summit. Advancing carefully, she discovered an entire goblin warband ready to pounce on the caravan, armed with several crude catapults prepared to fire on the road.

Taking advantage of the element of surprise, Aoife used her illusion magic to conjure a terrifying scream in the middle of the goblin encampment, scattering half of the raiders. The remaining two dozen goblins retreated to the catapults, protected by crude barricades and under the command of a foursome of tough-looking goblin bosses. Before the raiders could organize themselves once more, Aoife summoned another illusion, this an image of Aurora to wheel around overhead drawing fire, while Lily sent her familiar Trouble to sabotage one of the catapults. As the camp descended into chaos once again, the Aoife commanded the real Aurora to "freeze big goblin sticks." The loyal dragon leapt into action, bringing down one of the catapults and its crew with her icy breath.

Aoife and Lily began to barrage the encampment with magic, striking the nearest barricade with magic missiles and eldritch blasts. As the goblins tried to rally, Aoife advanced forward and toasted the closest boss with a fan of flames, while Lily blew out another barricade and its defenders with an explosive fireball. The goblins finally returned fire with spears and arrows, and the burned boss tried to advance on Aoife with its scimitar, only to fall victim to another fire spell. Lily drew her rapier and closed with the goblins manning the remaining catapult, supported by Aoife who brought down the boss there with a bolt of lightning. Aurora savaged the remaining boss at the barricades, and Lily set the remaining catapult and its guards alight. Aoife brought down the final barricade with one more burst of arcane missiles, and Aurora caught the last goblin as it attempted to flee.

Although a number of goblins had initially fled, they were no danger to the expedition without their bosses or their catapults, and the party returned to the caravan to see several goblin corpses on the side of the road. After checking in with Darvin, the caravan got moving once again.

<!-- Date: Day 3 -->

The night passed without incident, and on the third day the expedition continued north into a maze of narrow box canyons. According to Taliesan's maps, the entrance to the Library was somewhere within the canyons. As a precaution, Lily had her familiar Trouble fly overwatch above the caravan. As the caravan traveled, Aoife began to have an unsettling sense that she was being hunted. When asked, Lily could not reach Trouble, and feared she would have to resummon her familiar. Even Aurora seemed nervous, reporting "death smell" all around them. Aoife realised that there are no small animals at all in the canyons - the badlands are completely still aside from the caravan.

The sun was directly overhead as the caravan rounded the final bend, revealing a large hollow lined with stone pillars, carved with serpentine figures entwined around them. The canyon narrowed above, while a single gallery at the far end of the hollow lead down into the rock. As the expedition approached, however, they were met by whispering voices and then the threatening laughter of three disparate voices in eerie unison. Aoife spotted a hulking figure on all fours moving through the pillars on all fours, taunting the caravan with promises to crunch their bones and savor their screams. She attempted to stall the creature as the guards formed a line with crossbows ready. Unfortunately, a second beast - another chimera - dropped from the sky, crushing two of the horses and scattering the rest, overturning some of the wagons.

Aoife stuck the chimera in the center of the caravan with a bolt of lightning. Aurora leapt at the same beast and tried to freeze it to the ground with her breath weapon, but it pursued her into the air with its own fiery breath. The second chimera took advantage of the chaos to bound forward and scatter the crossbowmen with its breath weapon before savaging Darvin with a bit from its leonine head. Lily attempted to strike it with an orb of unstable energy, while Dean Artemisia emerged from an overturned wagon and struck the chimera with a cone of prismatic light, complaining about incompetent hirelings.

Aoife blasted the chimera fighting Aurora with another with another bolt of lightning, allowing Aurora to turn and grapple it with her bite and tail. The beast launched one more desperate attack before attempting to flee, but the dragon nearly tore its wing off in retaliation, sending the chimera spiraling down to a lethal crash on the rocks. The other chimera launched itself at Aoife to bring the dangerous spellcaster down, and nearly eviscerates her with its claws beore Aoife can bring up an arcane shield. Artemisia follows up with a barrage of magic missiles. With the chimera right in her face, Aoife tries to catch it in a burning hands spell, but the beast leapt backward to avoid the worst of the flames. Aoife took the opportunity to disengage, allowing Aurora to dive in with her freezing breath. The chimera managed to evade the worst of the cold, but already wounded, tbe foul creature chose to retreat, crushing another pair of trapped horses before launching into the air. Lily managed to strike it with an orb of corrosive magic before the chimera flew above the canyon walls and out of sight, promising that none from the caravan would leave the canyons alive.

In the wake of the chimeras attack, the expedition was left in shambles, with most of the guards burned or with borken limbs and several wagons overturned. Aoife lends most of her magic to healing the guards, while the rest of the expedition moves the supplies into the pillars to serve as a base camp, and sets up crude barricades with wood from the damaged wagons. Dean Artemisia thoroughly alienated Aoife with an ill-chosen remark, but promised to personally take care of the return journey.

With the base camp prepared, Aoife, Lily, Aurora, Artemisia and Darvin explored the stone gallery, finding an antechamber with a pair of ornate doors surrounded by druidic script. As Aoife approached, she could feel the talisman she had been given in the library annex thrum with power, and the writing lit up in a rainbow of colors before the doors swung slowly open, shedding a century's worth of dust from their mechanisms.

From the antechamber, another gallery descended deeper into the earth, winding back and forth and carved with more draconic script and strange abstract shapes. As the part descended, torches lit up on the walls, erupting with golden flames that did not give off any smoke. The gallery ended in a large circular chamber with a domed roof, easily a hundred paces across. Four more corridors extended out in the cardinal directions, while a circular stairwell descended deeper into the earth. The walls were lined with scrolls, or displays of curious artifacts - a giant curved horn from some unknown creature, a strange plant with softly-glowing violet leaves, a small animal skeleton that seemed to float of its own accord.

As Aoife neared the chamber, a ghostly figure appeared before her in a burst of ephemeral leaves. The apparition had horns on its head and the lower body of a goat, and introduced itself as Tybalt, the Librarian. Aoife introduced herself and the remainder of the group. Tybalt bid the group welcome, as it had been many years since the library had received visitors. The four galleries of the library - of Earth, of Wind, of Water, and of Flame - were open for browsing, but access to the special collections below required either permission from a High Druid or a blessing earned from challenges in the four galleries. Tybalt assured the group that the challenges were quite deadly, of course. He also warned that nothing could be removed from the library.

Aoife took the opportunity to ask Tybalt why the elementals were so angry. The spirit responded that, unfortunately, the library had lost his connection with the library annexes and the four elemental temples. His last recollection was that strange invaders had laid siege to the temples, and warned that if the temples were not properly maintained, the raw energies of the Sapphire Coast would run wild. He also recalled that the last group to come through had been trying to restore the temples - a high druid and his apprentices, who went down into the special collections and then vanished.

<!-- Session Break -->

As Aoife and Lily talked with the librarian, Taliesan found a handful of scrolls to start reading, while Dean Artemisia and Darvin seemed to be taking an inventory of the artifacts. Having apparently listened in on the conversation, the Dean ordered Aoife and Lily to get her into the library's special collections by any means necessary.

Leaving the expedition members from Amaranth behind, Aoife and Lily decide to head first to the eastern Gallery of Waves. To reach it, they must traverse a flooded tunnel; fortunately, the library provides fountains that dispense potions of water breathing, although explaining this to the dragon took some doing. The sunken corridor was lined with glyphs glowing a faint, shimmering blue-green, interspersed with poetry in the Aquan dialect of Primoridal.

The Gallery of Waves had an aquatic ambiance. Amidst its shelves of scrolls were displays of nets and tridents, paintings of merfolk rulers, elaborate displays of seashells, and aquaria from small to enormous holding rare fish, sharks, octopodes, and even creatures from the Elemental Plane of Water. The centerpiece of the gallery was an entire shipwreck, a high elven caravel that sank a millenium and a half ago, and one of the few surviving artifacts from the vanished ancient elven empires.

Aoife spent some time glancing through a few of the scrolls on offer, finding the history of the rule of a Naga chieftain and a philosophical examination of the tides. Asking Tybalt about the caravel shipwreck, she was given an impromptu history lesson about the elvish peoples - the ancient empires that vanishes without a trace at the dawn of the Age of Iron, and the three successor peoples. Of those, it was the shoal elves from whom she most likely descended. Meanwhile, Aurora found a fossilized turtle nest and settled in for a nap.

On the eastern wall of the gallery, a pair of great sealed doors held the entrance to the Trial of Water. Tybalt gave the party the following warning: "As the tide rises and falls, the Trial of Waves tests your ability to adapt to new circumstances."

Beyond the doors, a corridor sloped down into the first room of the trial chambers proper, flooded waist-deep, with balconies high overhead and a platform rocking gently on the water. Continuing on, the exit from the next chamber was locked, but a ladder gave access to another balcony with a door to the room before, while a pair of glyphs glowed on the wall above and below. Experimenting, Aoife discovered that touching the glyphs would cause the water in the chambers to rise to the height of the balconies or sink back to waist-high. Raising the water, they traveled back on the upper level and used the now floating platform to cross to a simple chest, which held a bronze key set with an emerald.

Lowering the water once more, they opened the locked door and traveled farther east to find a large eight-sided chamber with high vaulted ceiling. In its center a great whirlpool gurgled and roared, separated by a thin stone wall from the narrow path around. The four corner walls held great statues of a Naga, a Sahuagin lord, a Kraken, and a Dragon Turtle. The west wall behind held only the entrance door and a mosaic of a seashell above, while the eastern wall on the far side had a door opposite and an enclosed balcony high above.

Continuing on, Aoife and Lily found a long gallery with multiple floating platforms and more balconies high above. Farther east was a smaller chamber, with a chest and door on the far wall divided from the rest of the room by bars of some gleaming metal. Up above, a bridge spanned the length of the room, accessible by ladder; another door to the west lead back to the long gallery, while to the east above the barred alcove, another door stood flanked by a pair of stone Naga statues.

The upper level of the final chamber to the east held another of the glowing glyphs, with a square hole cut in the floor and opening into the space below, where another platform of the same size could be seen floating beneath. Raising and lowering the water, Aoife descended to the lower lever, where another glyph shone. On the far wall, where the door back to the barred alcove must stand, a ten-foot cube sat, seemingly of the same material as the floating platforms. Seeing the trick, Aoife sent Lily above to keep an eye on things, while she triggered the glyph below.

As expected, raising the water lifted the cube in front of the door, while the platform rose to seal the hole between the upper and lower chambers. However, Aoife also triggered a conjuration trap, finding herself alone to face a pair of summoned Kuo-Toa warriors. She quickly found herself engaged, using an arcane shield to block a trident and fins that crackled with electricity, while the second entangled her in a net. As she struggled to free herself, the water began to fall again at Lily's command. Both Kuo-Toa managed to stab Aoife with their tridents before she managed to cut herself loose, returning the favor with quick blows from her rapier as Lily leapt down to assist, together bringing down one of the fish-man warriors. The combatants exchanged another series of inconclusive blows before a lucky trident strike deeply wounded Aoife. Victorious, the Kuo-Toa turned and struck Lily with a charged blow from its fins, but an enraged Aoife skewered the fish-man with her rapier. Both slain Kuo-Toa vanished into nothingness.

With the trap properly sprung, Aoife and Lily solved the remainder of the puzzle, raising the water to access the barred alcove and the key held within, and then lowering and re-raising it to access the upper chamber once more. Following the upper path back to the west, they used the key to open the last door and stepped onto the balcony above the whirlpool chamber. There, a flowing rune inlaid with lapis shone above an Aquan inscription, "touch the rune to accept the Blessing of Water". Aoife and Lily both did so, feeling a soothing rush of energy, before accepting a ride from the watching Tybalt back to the library's central core.

Aoife and Lily reappeared in the core chamber, along with Aurora who arrived with a disgruntled yelp. Artemisia demanded a report on the "defenses" of the Gallery of Waves, before leaving with Darvin and Taliesan to begin cataloguing the treasures there. As they left, Tybalt gave a friendly warning to Aoife and Lily - that "only the most confident of aspirants have attempted trials back to back".
