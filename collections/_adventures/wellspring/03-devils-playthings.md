Roya discovers a strange rune in the Fortress Ruins beneath the Market District. Mo translates it as a distorted Infernal rune for "the hunt".

The Silverstone Players attend a fundraiser for the Delver's Guild, sponsored by Dame Savindar. At the party, they are approached by a young woman named Katerine, who mentions a secret gathering for those interested in the "darker" aspects of magic.

Mo receives a heavily perfumed letter from bosomy would-be sorceress Katerine, inviting her to "ladies salon". Meanwhile, tensions rise in the Market District as vandals run wild. The Delver's Guild reaches out to Roya's family enterprise for help keeping an eye on the Fortress Ruins.

Roya follows up with her family regarding strange things in the Fortress Ruins - apparently someone has been moving around navigational markers, setting up crude traps and pranks. She asks the rest of the Silverstone Players to stake out the ruins, to which the rest of the party agrees. Meanwhile, Mo replies to Katerina, indicating her interest in the "ladies salon".

After their evening performance, the Silverstone Players gather their supplies and head to the Market District. There are a lot of armed guards, both City Guard and hired thugs, and occasional signs of scorch marks on the wall or graffiti. Beginning their descent into the Fortress Ruins, Roya hears the sounds of wings and decides to scout ahead invisibly. She immediately stumbles over a hidden tripwire on the stairs, and hears disembodied laughter like malicious children.

Feeling cautious, Py sends her steel defender ahead of the party as they start exploring the ruins. The steel defender is quickly caught in a falling weighted net trap, accompanied by more quiet giggling. Attempting to lure out their hidden tormentors, Mo tries to fake a pratfall but manages to actually twist her ankle.

With Verity left by herself, she is suddenly tripped by a pair of invisible creatures. Mo responded by casting faerie fire, revealing two imps dancing and cackling. As the party went to assist Verity, two more appeared and attacked Mo, fended off only by a hasty shield spell. Py grabbed one imp out of the air, while Roya used the net trap to capture another and trap it inside of Py's steel defender. Verity used an eldritch blast to snipe the imp in Py's hands, causing it to explode into a cloud of foul sulfurous smoke. Mo managed to restrain the two remaining imps, who promptly ignored the party to try and bite and wrestle each other.

<!-- Session Break -->

The Silverstone Players brought their captured imps to the Delver's Guild, and met with their usual contact Mialee. Demons are very rarely found beneath Wellspring, and at first there was some concern that an old giantish gate may have connected to an infernal realm. Fortunately, because the imps had been summoned rather than physically present, there was little risk to the city. Mialee asked the party to continue investigating, and to try and find whoever was responsible for the summoning. She also suggested that if the party wished to trace the imp's connections, they might wish to contact the Watchers of the Stars. Mo sent a message with familiar to Cyrene, asking for information or a meeting.

As the party was making ready to leave, a dwarf with a leather satchel approaches. She introduces herself as Morana Durthane, an archivist with the Guild. To Verity's astonishment, Morana says that she has found what may be her brother Honor's journal. Unfortunately the delvers that found the journal did not give many details on its discovery. Shaken, Verity departs alone for home.

The remainder of the group waits at the Delver's Guild for Cyrene, who offers to perform an augury or other divination. She carefully examines the imps and determines that there is no familiar bond, but there are traces of some sort of lingering blood magic. Unfortunately Cyrene did not have any more information about the infernal rune Roya had discovered. With nothing more to learn without more powerful divinations, the party dispelled the imps and returned home for the night.

The party reconvened the following morning, where Mo received an invitation from Katerine to afternoon tea at The Green Grotto, a faerie-themed tea shop in the Noble's Quarter. The Silverstone Players promptly fell into a deep discussion over what Mo should wear to tea, whether Mo required a chaperone, and whether one of the other members should disguise themself as Mo while Mo herself attended invisibly.

With some time before tea, the Silverstone Players return to the Market District. On the way, Roya asks some of the shopkeepers if the vandalism continued overnight; aside from some petty theft, there were no reported incidents. The party descends into the ruins. While Mo attempts to map out the ruins to see if the layout has an infernal connection, Verity and Py hear an ominous slithering sound from farther down the corridor. Roya lights an arrow with some lamp oil, catching a glimpse of a large chitinous creature.

The party debates their next move for a few moments until Py sends an illuminated homonculous servant down the corridor. The servant is quickly attacked by a large centipede-like creature, which climbs the ceiling to pursue the flying construct before stumbling over a second one of its kind farther down. The party collectively decides to flee, hearing a horrifying metallic crunch from somewhere behind them as they return to the surface.

Roya departs to warn her family and then the Delver's Guild about the monsters in the ruins. Meanwhile, Mo, Verity and Py return to the theater to prepare for Mo's tea engagement. Mo decided to dress extra for the occasion, with Py providing metal pauldrons to match the cape and makeup. After Verity gave an encouraging speech, Mo departed alone for tea.

Mo meets with Katerine at the Green Grotto, who is eager to induct her new friend into a secret society hidden beneath Wellspring, calling themselves the Black Sepulchre. The group is lead by a shadowy figure known only as Brother Nocturne. The membership is technically anonymous, although Katerine knows that several of her friends attend; Katerine herself goes under the pseudonym of Sister Midnight.

Katerine also revealed that she and her friends have practiced demon summoning outside of the meetings, successfully calling forth imps, although she admitted that none of the group knows how to dismiss them again. Brother Nocturne summons more impressive creatures at the society's meetings, which are called Dark Revels. Katerine invites Mo to attend the next meeting as her guest, set for the evening of the 15th to harness the magical energies of the solstice. Mo is advised to wear a black cloak and a face mask; also, to choose an alias carefully, as teh last meeting had three Sister Ravens and there was drama.

<!-- Session Break -->

Upon her return to the theater, the rest of the Silverstone Players interrogate Mo about the Black Sepulchre, and discover an additional details about Brother Nocturne - while he wears a hooded cloak with long sleeves to hide his identity, Katerine once caught a glimpse of glowing tattoos. From there, the party split in different directions.

Roya ventured to the Delver's Guild, where she met with a guild representative and discussed the "centipedes" the party encountered. Based on Roya's description, the monsters were carrion crawlers, subterranean beasts drawn to the metaphorical scent of old death. The guild representative warned that carrion crawlers were dangerous foes, with the ability to climb walls and ceilings, attack even in lightless conditions, and with paralytic poison on their tentacles. She then warned her family's tour company about the carrion crawlers; tours are now suspended, and the company will reach out to their neighbors to try and fund a bounty for clearing out the monster, although it may take a few days.

Mo headed up the mountains to the Celestial Observatory. Having sent word ahead, Cyrene met Mo right as she was intercepted by the guardian monks, and led Mo to her small study. Mo shared what the party had learned thus far; Cyrene was not aware of any cult activity, but did observe that a comet had passed directly behind the shadow moon Malus. She did express surprise at the mention of a male Sherem spellcaster, as they were a cultural rarity. After digging into her notes, Cyrene found an additional mention of a number of meteorites burning out near the same comet.

While Roya and Mo were away, Verity called Py aside to talk about the discovery of her brother's journal. Verity is especially distressed at the possibility Honor was still alive after he disappeared, but is concerned about deception or manipulation. Verity shared the surviving entries in the journal with Py, along with her "conspiracy board". Py immediately offers her assistance, although Verity is not sure how Py can help. Py offers to investigate the journal itself to at least identify an obvious fake. Verity accepts the offer, and on a quick examination the book looks genuine; it will take a few days for an alchemical investigation to bear fruit.

The Silverstone Players reconvene at the theater, and the rest of the group are filled in on Roya and Mo's errands. After some debate, the party decides to venture down into the Fortress Ruins once more. At the prompting of Mo's familiar, the party invites Cyrene to join them, and around noon return to the Market District to descend into the depths. Roya's family has set up a makeshift barricade around the ruins entrance, and are engaged in a heating argument with a human and a dwarf in the uniform of the City Guard. After a brief argument, the dwarf guardsman threatens to have the barricade forcibly torn down if it's not removed by sundown, but allows the party to pass through.

Down within the fortress ruins, the party descends into a warren of storerooms and quickly come across a small nest of carrion crawlers. Verity gives an inspiring speech before the party closed. Verity, Roya, and Py engage it with bow and crossbow without success, although Mo manages to wound the monstrousity with a mental attack. The party manages to wound it with bolt and arrow as a second approaches at the edge of their light, while Mo scorches it with a fiery ray. Mo follows up by trapping the second crawler in lava illusion, while Roya strikes down the first with a carefully placed arrow.

While the second crawler retreats from the illusory lava, a third is charging the party from behind. Roya meets the third carrion crawler with rapier in hand, while Verity lands a curse slowing its reactions. Cyrene finally manages to cast her spell successfully, firing a barrage of magic missiles at the second carrion crawler. The crawler engaged with Roya attempted to ensnare her with its tentacles, but she shakes off its paralytic venom in time to evade its mandibles. Meanwhile, the second crawler attempts to flee, but Mo fires a sleep enchantment blindly into the darkness. Roya dodges away from the third crawler and returns to the rest of the party before it was brought down by another barrage of magic missiles. Py and Roya collaborate on another spell-lit arrow to reveal the last sleeping crawler, and Py steps forward with her giant wrench to deliver the final blow.

The party investigates the warren of storerooms, discovering the nest of the carrion crawlers along with the remains of a couple of victims - apparently a couple of footpads with chipped daggers and 20 gold worth of currency in their coin pouches. Venturing further, Roya finds several more of the infernal runes marking a pathway through the labyrinth, along with tracks from the carrion crawlers (leading away from the rune-marked path) and human footprints (heading both directions). Both the tracks and the runic marks terminated at what seemed to be the external wall of the once-fortress; however, it was inexplicably warm to the touch, and a divination revealed the presence of conjuration magic. Likewise, Mo calculated that the party was actually near the center of the ruins; thus, the fortress wall was very much out of place.

To be continued...
