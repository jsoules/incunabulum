Roya discovers a strange rune in the Fortress Ruins beneath the Market District. Mo translates it as a distorted Infernal rune for "the hunt".

The Silverstone Players attend a fundraiser for the Delver's Guild, sponsored by Dame Savindar. At the party, they are approached by a young woman named Katerine, who mentions a secret gathering for those interested in the "darker" aspects of magic.

Mo receives a heavily perfumed letter from bosomy would-be sorceress Katerine, inviting her to "ladies salon". Meanwhile, tensions rise in the Market District as vandals run wild. The Delver's Guild reaches out to Roya's family enterprise for help keeping an eye on the Fortress Ruins.

Roya follows up with her family regarding strange things in the Fortress Ruins - apparently someone has been moving around navigational markers, setting up crude traps and pranks. She asks the rest of the Silverstone Players to stake out the ruins, to which the rest of the party agrees. Meanwhile, Mo replies to Katerina, indicating her interest in the "ladies salon".

After their evening performance, the Silverstone Players gather their supplies and head to the Market District. There are a lot of armed guards, both City Guard and hired thugs, and occasional signs of scorch marks on the wall or graffiti. Beginning their descent into the Fortress Ruins, Roya hears the sounds of wings and decides to scout ahead invisibly. She immediately stumbles over a hidden tripwire on the stairs, and hears disembodied laughter like malicious children.

Feeling cautious, Py sends her steel defender ahead of the party as they start exploring the ruins. The steel defender is quickly caught in a falling weighted net trap, accompanied by more quiet giggling. Attempting to lure out their hidden tormentors, Mo tries to fake a pratfall but manages to actually twist her ankle.

With Verity left by herself, she is suddenly tripped by a pair of invisible creatures. Mo responded by casting faerie fire, revealing two imps dancing and cackling. As the party went to assist Verity, two more appeared and attacked Mo, fended off only by a hasty shield spell. Py grabbed one imp out of the air, while Roya used the net trap to capture another and trap it inside of Py's steel defender. Verity used an eldritch blast to snipe the imp in Py's hands, causing it to explode into a cloud of foul sulfurous smoke. Mo managed to restrain the two remaining imps, who promptly ignored the party to try and bite and wrestle each other.

The Silverstone Players brought their captured imps to the Delver's Guild, and met with their usual contact Mialee. Demons are very rarely found beneath Wellspring, and at first there was some concern that an old giantish gate may have connected to an infernal realm. Fortunately, because the imps had been summoned rather than physically present, there was little risk to the city. Mialee asked the party to continue investigating, and to try and find whoever was responsible for the summoning. She also suggested that if the party wished to trace the imp's connections, they might wish to contact the Watchers of the Stars. Mo sent a message with familiar to Cyrene, asking for information or a meeting.

As the party was making ready to leave, a dwarf with a leather satchel approaches. She introduces herself as Morana Durthane, an archivist with the Guild. To Verity's astonishment, Morana says that she has found what may be her brother Honor's journal. Unfortunately the delvers that found the journal did not give many details on its discovery. Shaken, Verity departs alone for home.

The remainder of the group waits at the Delver's Guild for Cyrene, who offers to perform an augury or other divination. She carefully examines the imps and determines that there is no familiar bond, but there are traces of some sort of lingering blood magic. Unfortunately Cyrene did not have any more information about the infernal rune Roya had discovered. With nothing more to learn without more powerful divinations, the party dispelled the imps and returned home for the night.

The party reconvened the following morning, where Mo received an invitation from Katerine to afternoon tea at The Green Grotto, a faerie-themed tea shop in the Noble's Quarter. The Silverstone Players promptly fell into a deep discussion over what Mo should wear to tea, whether Mo required a chaperone, and whether one of the other members should disguise themself as Mo while Mo herself attended invisibly.

With some time before tea, the Silverstone Players return to the Market District. On the way, Roya asks some of the shopkeepers if the vandalism continued overnight; aside from some petty theft, there were no reported incidents. The party descends into the ruins. While Mo attempts to map out the ruins to see if the layout has an infernal connection, Verity and Py hear an ominous slithering sound from farther down the corridor. Roya lights an arrow with some lamp oil, catching a glimpse of a large chitinous creature.

The party debates their next move for a few moments until Py sends an illuminated homonculous servant down the corridor. The servant is quickly attacked by a large centipede-like creature, which climbs the ceiling to pursue the flying construct before stumbling over a second one of its kind farther down. The party collectively decides to flee, hearing a horrifying metallic crunch from somewhere behind them as they return to the surface.

Roya departs to warn her family and then the Delver's Guild about the monsters in the ruins. Meanwhile, Mo, Verity and Py return to the theater to prepare for Mo's tea engagement. Mo decided to dress extra for the occasion, with Py providing metal pauldrons to match the cape and makeup. After Verity gave an encouraging speech, Mo departed alone for tea.

Mo meets with Katerine at the Green Grotto, who is eager to induct her new friend into a secret society hidden beneath Wellspring, calling themselves the Black Sepulchre. The group is lead by a shadowy figure known only as Brother Nocturne. The membership is technically anonymous, although Katerine knows that several of her friends attend; Katerine herself goes under the pseudonym of Sister Midnight.

Katerine also revealed that she and her friends have practiced demon summoning outside of the meetings, successfully calling forth imps, although she admitted that none of the group knows how to dismiss them again. Brother Nocturne summons more impressive creatures at the society's meetings, which are called Dark Revels. Katerine invites Mo to attend the next meeting as her guest, set for the evening of the 15th to harness the magical energies of the solstice. Mo is advised to wear a black cloak and a face mask; also, to choose an alias carefully, as teh last meeting had three Sister Ravens and there was drama.

Following tea, Mo returned to the theater and discussed the meeting with the rest of the Silverstone Players.
