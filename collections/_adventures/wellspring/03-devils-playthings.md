Roya discovers a strange rune in the Fortress Ruins beneath the Market District. Mo translates it as a distorted Infernal rune for "the hunt".

The Silverstone Players attend a fundraiser for the Delver's Guild, sponsored by Dame Savindar. At the party, they are approached by a young woman named Katerine, who mentions a secret gathering for those interested in the "darker" aspects of magic.

Mo receives a heavily perfumed letter from bosomy would-be sorceress Katerine, inviting her to "ladies salon". Meanwhile, tensions rise in the Market District as vandals run wild. The Delver's Guild reaches out to Roya's family enterprise for help keeping an eye on the Fortress Ruins.

Roya follows up with her family regarding strange things in the Fortress Ruins - apparently someone has been moving around navigational markers, setting up crude traps and pranks. She asks the rest of the Silverstone Players to stake out the ruins, to which the rest of the party agrees. Meanwhile, Mo replies to Katerina, indicating her interest in the "ladies salon".

After their evening performance, the Silverstone Players gather their supplies and head to the Market District. There are a lot of armed guards, both City Guard and hired thugs, and occasional signs of scorch marks on the wall or graffiti. Beginning their descent into the Fortress Ruins, Roya hears the sounds of wings and decides to scout ahead invisibly. She immediately stumbles over a hidden tripwire on the stairs, and hears disembodied laughter like malicious children.

Feeling cautious, Py sends her steel defender ahead of the party as they start exploring the ruins. The steel defender is quickly caught in a falling weighted net trap, accompanied by more quiet giggling. Attempting to lure out their hidden tormentors, Mo tries to fake a pratfall but manages to actually twist her ankle.

With Verity left by herself, she is suddenly tripped by a pair of invisible creatures. Mo responded by casting faerie fire, revealing two imps dancing and cackling. As the party went to assist Verity, two more appeared and attacked Mo, fended off only by a hasty shield spell. Py grabbed one imp out of the air, while Roya used the net trap to capture another and trap it inside of Py's steel defender. Verity used an eldritch blast to snipe the imp in Py's hands, causing it to explode into a cloud of foul sulfurous smoke. Mo managed to restrain the two remaining imps, who promptly ignored the party to try and bite and wrestle each other.

The party resolved to bring the captured imps to the Delver's Guild.
