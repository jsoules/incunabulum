Roya discovers a strange rune in the Fortress Ruins beneath the Market District. Mo translates it as a distorted Infernal rune for "the hunt".

> Date: [25 Serpent]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures#summer-2258)

The Silverstone Players attend a fundraiser for the Delver's Guild, sponsored by Dame Savindar. At the party, they are approached by a young woman named Katerine, who mentions a secret gathering for those interested in the "darker" aspects of magic.

> Date: [5 Dragon]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures#summer-2258)

Mo receives a heavily perfumed letter from bosomy would-be sorceress Katerine, inviting her to "ladies salon". Meanwhile, tensions rise in the Market District as vandals run wild. The Delver's Guild reaches out to Roya's family enterprise for help keeping an eye on the Fortress Ruins.

> Date: [10 Dragon]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures#summer-2258)

Roya follows up with her family regarding strange things in the Fortress Ruins - apparently someone has been moving around navigational markers, setting up crude traps and pranks. She asks the rest of the Silverstone Players to stake out the ruins, to which the rest of the party agrees. Meanwhile, Mo replies to Katerina, indicating her interest in the "ladies salon".

After their evening performance, the Silverstone Players gather their supplies and head to the Market District. There are a lot of armed guards, both City Guard and hired thugs, and occasional signs of scorch marks on the wall or graffiti. Beginning their descent into the Fortress Ruins, Roya hears the sounds of wings and decides to scout ahead invisibly. She immediately stumbles over a hidden tripwire on the stairs, and hears disembodied laughter like malicious children.

Feeling cautious, Py sends her steel defender ahead of the party as they start exploring the ruins. The steel defender is quickly caught in a falling weighted net trap, accompanied by more quiet giggling. Attempting to lure out their hidden tormentors, Mo tries to fake a pratfall but manages to actually twist her ankle.

With Verity left by herself, she is suddenly tripped by a pair of invisible creatures. Mo responded by casting faerie fire, revealing two imps dancing and cackling. As the party went to assist Verity, two more appeared and attacked Mo, fended off only by a hasty shield spell. Py grabbed one imp out of the air, while Roya used the net trap to capture another and trap it inside of Py's steel defender. Verity used an eldritch blast to snipe the imp in Py's hands, causing it to explode into a cloud of foul sulfurous smoke. Mo managed to restrain the two remaining imps, who promptly ignored the party to try and bite and wrestle each other.

<!-- Session Break -->

The Silverstone Players brought their captured imps to the Delver's Guild, and met with their usual contact Mialee. Demons are very rarely found beneath Wellspring, and at first there was some concern that an old giantish gate may have connected to an infernal realm. Fortunately, because the imps had been summoned rather than physically present, there was little risk to the city. Mialee asked the party to continue investigating, and to try and find whoever was responsible for the summoning. She also suggested that if the party wished to trace the imp's connections, they might wish to contact the Watchers of the Stars. Mo sent a message with familiar to Cyrene, asking for information or a meeting.

As the party was making ready to leave, a dwarf with a leather satchel approaches. She introduces herself as Morana Durthane, an archivist with the Guild. To Verity's astonishment, Morana says that she has found what may be her brother Honor's journal. Unfortunately the delvers that found the journal did not give many details on its discovery. Shaken, Verity departs alone for home.

The remainder of the group waits at the Delver's Guild for Cyrene, who offers to perform an augury or other divination. She carefully examines the imps and determines that there is no familiar bond, but there are traces of some sort of lingering blood magic. Unfortunately Cyrene did not have any more information about the infernal rune Roya had discovered. With nothing more to learn without more powerful divinations, the party dispelled the imps and returned home for the night.

The party reconvened the following morning, where Mo received an invitation from Katerine to afternoon tea at The Green Grotto, a faerie-themed tea shop in the Noble's Quarter. The Silverstone Players promptly fell into a deep discussion over what Mo should wear to tea, whether Mo required a chaperone, and whether one of the other members should disguise themself as Mo while Mo herself attended invisibly.

With some time before tea, the Silverstone Players return to the Market District. On the way, Roya asks some of the shopkeepers if the vandalism continued overnight; aside from some petty theft, there were no reported incidents. The party descends into the ruins. While Mo attempts to map out the ruins to see if the layout has an infernal connection, Verity and Py hear an ominous slithering sound from farther down the corridor. Roya lights an arrow with some lamp oil, catching a glimpse of a large chitinous creature.

The party debates their next move for a few moments until Py sends an illuminated homonculous servant down the corridor. The servant is quickly attacked by a large centipede-like creature, which climbs the ceiling to pursue the flying construct before stumbling over a second one of its kind farther down. The party collectively decides to flee, hearing a horrifying metallic crunch from somewhere behind them as they return to the surface.

Roya departs to warn her family and then the Delver's Guild about the monsters in the ruins. Meanwhile, Mo, Verity and Py return to the theater to prepare for Mo's tea engagement. Mo decided to dress extra for the occasion, with Py providing metal pauldrons to match the cape and makeup. After Verity gave an encouraging speech, Mo departed alone for tea.

Mo meets with Katerine at the Green Grotto, who is eager to induct her new friend into a secret society hidden beneath Wellspring, calling themselves the Black Sepulchre. The group is lead by a shadowy figure known only as Brother Nocturne. The membership is technically anonymous, although Katerine knows that several of her friends attend; Katerine herself goes under the pseudonym of Sister Midnight.

Katerine also revealed that she and her friends have practiced demon summoning outside of the meetings, successfully calling forth imps, although she admitted that none of the group knows how to dismiss them again. Brother Nocturne summons more impressive creatures at the society's meetings, which are called Dark Revels. Katerine invites Mo to attend the next meeting as her guest, set for the evening of the 15th to harness the magical energies of the solstice. Mo is advised to wear a black cloak and a face mask; also, to choose an alias carefully, as teh last meeting had three Sister Ravens and there was drama.

<!-- Session Break -->

Upon her return to the theater, the rest of the Silverstone Players interrogate Mo about the Black Sepulchre, and discover an additional details about Brother Nocturne - while he wears a hooded cloak with long sleeves to hide his identity, Katerine once caught a glimpse of glowing tattoos. From there, the party split in different directions.

Roya ventured to the Delver's Guild, where she met with a guild representative and discussed the "centipedes" the party encountered. Based on Roya's description, the monsters were carrion crawlers, subterranean beasts drawn to the metaphorical scent of old death. The guild representative warned that carrion crawlers were dangerous foes, with the ability to climb walls and ceilings, attack even in lightless conditions, and with paralytic poison on their tentacles. She then warned her family's tour company about the carrion crawlers; tours are now suspended, and the company will reach out to their neighbors to try and fund a bounty for clearing out the monster, although it may take a few days.

Mo headed up the mountains to the Celestial Observatory. Having sent word ahead, Cyrene met Mo right as she was intercepted by the guardian monks, and led Mo to her small study. Mo shared what the party had learned thus far; Cyrene was not aware of any cult activity, but did observe that a comet had passed directly behind the shadow moon Malus. She did express surprise at the mention of a male Sherem spellcaster, as they were a cultural rarity. After digging into her notes, Cyrene found an additional mention of a number of meteorites burning out near the same comet.

While Roya and Mo were away, Verity called Py aside to talk about the discovery of her brother's journal. Verity is especially distressed at the possibility Honor was still alive after he disappeared, but is concerned about deception or manipulation. Verity shared the surviving entries in the journal with Py, along with her "conspiracy board". Py immediately offers her assistance, although Verity is not sure how Py can help. Py offers to investigate the journal itself to at least identify an obvious fake. Verity accepts the offer, and on a quick examination the book looks genuine; it will take a few days for an alchemical investigation to bear fruit.

The Silverstone Players reconvene at the theater, and the rest of the group are filled in on Roya and Mo's errands. After some debate, the party decides to venture down into the Fortress Ruins once more. At the prompting of Mo's familiar, the party invites Cyrene to join them, and around noon return to the Market District to descend into the depths. Roya's family has set up a makeshift barricade around the ruins entrance, and are engaged in a heated argument with a human and a dwarf in the uniform of the City Guard. After a brief argument, the dwarf guardsman threatens to have the barricade forcibly torn down if it's not removed by sundown, but allows the party to pass through.

Down within the fortress ruins, the party descends into a warren of storerooms and quickly come across a small nest of carrion crawlers. Verity gives an inspiring speech before the party closed. Verity, Roya, and Py engage it with bow and crossbow without success, although Mo manages to wound the monstrosity with a mental attack. The party manages to wound it with bolt and arrow as a second approaches at the edge of their light, while Mo scorches it with a fiery ray. Mo follows up by trapping the second crawler in lava illusion, while Roya strikes down the first with a carefully placed arrow.

While the second crawler retreats from the illusory lava, a third is charging the party from behind. Roya meets the third carrion crawler with rapier in hand, while Verity lands a curse slowing its reactions. Cyrene finally manages to cast her spell successfully, firing a barrage of magic missiles at the second carrion crawler. The crawler engaged with Roya attempted to ensnare her with its tentacles, but she shakes off its paralytic venom in time to evade its mandibles. Meanwhile, the second crawler attempts to flee, but Mo fires a sleep enchantment blindly into the darkness. Roya dodges away from the third crawler and returns to the rest of the party before it was brought down by another barrage of magic missiles. Py and Roya collaborate on another spell-lit arrow to reveal the last sleeping crawler, and Py steps forward with her giant wrench to deliver the final blow.

The party investigates the warren of storerooms, discovering the nest of the carrion crawlers along with the remains of a couple of victims - apparently a couple of footpads with chipped daggers and 20 gold worth of currency in their coin pouches. Venturing further, Roya finds several more of the infernal runes marking a pathway through the labyrinth, along with tracks from the carrion crawlers (leading away from the rune-marked path) and human footprints (heading both directions). Both the tracks and the runic marks terminated at what seemed to be the external wall of the once-fortress; however, it was inexplicably warm to the touch, and a divination revealed the presence of conjuration magic. Likewise, Mo calculated that the party was actually near the center of the ruins; thus, the fortress wall was very much out of place.

<!-- Session Break -->

Roya recalls that beyond the conjured wall is a ruined chapel, where the dead were once prepared for interment. While Mo and Roya debate magical theory on conjuration and banishment, Py pulls out a giant hammer and smashes it into the out-of-place wall. There was a loud, dissonant whine at the impact, and the cracks quickly filled in with an orange light and a lingering scent of sulphur.

The Silverstone Players attempt to bypass the wall, with Roya painting the infernal rune on the wall first in black chalk and then in the blood of the dead carrion crawlers. The wall was strangely resistant to markings; the chalk flaked off at the slightest breeze, while the blood dripped off in a deeply unsettling manner. Unfortunately, the wall was otherwise unaffected. Stymied for now, the party returned to the surface, but not before Mo sets a magical alarm to keep an eye on the area.

Back at the surface, Roya confronts the guards with the severed head of one of the carrion crawlers. The guards begrudgingly agreed that the ruins were unsafe, and declared them closed until further notice. From there, the party debated strategy; they considered but rejected involving Dame Savindar; reaching out to Lucas and Martin or their contacts in the Harfood Syndicate; or asking the Delver's Guild to help investigating the conjured wall beneath the marketplace. They decide the best path forward is to infiltrate the planned Dark Revel, using the dress code of masks and black cloaks to bring the entire group. Py would take on the name of Sister Nightshade, Mo as Sister Hellebore, Roya as Sister Ouibliette, and Verity as Sister Sable.

Mo will also use the remaining time studying at the library of the Arcane Order. Unfortunately, most of the references to a connection between the planes and the skies refer to a tome titled *As Above, So Below: A Treatise On The Skies And The Four Arcana*, which Mo was unable to find. She also reached out to Cyrene, who shared some basic knowledge; unfortunately her studies focused on the area of divination, rather than conjuration or banishment.

> Date: [15 Dragon]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures#summer-2258)

At noon, Mo receives a couriered communique from Katerine, instructing her to meet at "the entrance to the old ruins in the market" an hour before midnight. The party has a last-minute huddle regarding their strategy - are they planning to disrupt the ceremony, or merely observe and gather information? They decided to take a wait and see approach. Ahead of the scheduled time, Roya checked the ruins entrance and found it barricaded by a pair of very bored City Guards.

At the appointed hour, Mo and the rest of the Silverstone Players approach the entrance to the ruins. A number of other figures in masks and black cloaks are filtering into the district, with others brazenly stepping off of carriages directly in front of the ruins. Mo met with Katerine in her guise as "Sister Midnight" at the entrance, and was ushered inside; the missing guards were found hidden behind the barricades, snoring.

The Silverstone Players then descended into the ruins amongst the gaggle of black cloaks. Mo kept company with Katerine, although she did not share the latter's enthusiasm for an introduction to the sinister Brother Nocturne. Meanwhile, Roya tried to avoid notice, and Py and Verity singled out a lone watcher at the edge of the group. He admitted he was also attending a Dark Revel for the first time, and had trouble choosing a name; Verity suggested the name "Vespers", which he gratefully adopted. Py attempted to put Vespers off with alchemy talk and instead managed to forge a connection by talking about brassware; he reintroduced himself as Richart, the nephew of the biggest importer of brass into Wellspring, and boasted about his uncle's new partnership with a merchant in the Free Cities for high-quality copper.

At the heart of the ruins, the party came across the same conjured wall as before, with the would-be cultists gathered before it in apparent anticipation. Abruptly, the wall vanished in a burst of fire, revealing Brother Nocturne standing behind. "Welcome, brothers and sisters!" he intoned. "The Dark Revel begins!"

<!-- Session Break -->

The ruins chapel was in surprisingly good shape, with a vaulted ceiling over chipped and battered pews and a bare stone altar. At the back of the chapel, a partially collapse was patched with another conjured wall, while candles decorated the pews or floated in the air of their own accord. At the center of the chapel a circle was inscribed on the floor in glowing runes.

Brother Nocturne opened the revel with an invocation of the solstice. He then pointedly invited any new members to introduce themselves, conjuring a fireball above Roya's head when no one stepped forward. Thinking quickly, the party said they had been invited by a "Sister Raven", while Mo truthfully stated she was invited by Katerine as "Sister Midnight".

With the Silverstone Players not taking the bait, Brother Nocturne then asked the members of the Black Sepulchre to gather around the summoning circle. While Mo attempted to analyze the circle, Py looked around for other magical implements and Verity focused on Brother Nocturne himself. She heard traces of a hidden Sherem accent and caught a glimpse of glowing tattoos, but it was clear that the man was putting on a performance for the rest of the Sepulchre. She attempted to read his thoughts, catching a brief sense of amusement before her spell was interrupted by a vision of an infernal visage. As she was evicted from his mind, he clearly heard the words "so precocious, little interloper". The redirected magic also caught the hem of her cloak aflame.

As the ritual continued, the circle began to whirl with sulfurous smoke filled with glowing embers, and a hulking, winged figure began to take shape. Trying to interrupt the summoning, Mo cast a suggestion on one of Katerine's friends, making her believe that Brother Nocturne would be overwhelmed by the demon. Terrified, she attempted to rush across and beg him to end the ritual, but stumbled across the edge of the circle and was burned on her leg. Roya attempted to cast off her cloak and turn invisible, but botched the timing, drawing more attention. Undeterred, she sneaked around behind Brother Nocturne while Mo conjured an image of her own demon in the circle.

Unfortunately, as an invisible Roya tried to club Brother Nocturne with the butt of her dagger, a glowing shield of hellfire appeared in front of her and intercepted the attack, burning and revealing her. Mo stepped forward and accused Brother Nocturne of being a charlatan, to which the latter responded with amusement: "Shall we have a duel, then? Your 'demon' against mine?" As he spoke, the summoning ritual completed, and a hulking spined demon stood in the center of the circle. Fearing a battle between warlocks, most of the Black Sepulchre fled, with only a handful standing behind their leader.

As the Silverstone Players hesitated, still hoping for a peaceful resolution, Brother Nocturne took advantage of their indecision and sealed off the entrance with another conjured wall, before dissolving the summoning circle with a snap of his fingers and freeing the demon trapped inside. As he did so, Mo noticed that Brother Nocturne shimmered for a moment, as if under an illusion, while the four remaining cultists drew long daggers from their robes.

Fearing they were trapped with a superior foe, Roya took the initiative and loosed an arrow at the cult leader. Mo launched a volley of magical bolts at Brother Nocturne, while Verity laid a curse of ill fortune on leader and cultists alike. No disc of hellfire protected the cult leader this time, and he stumbled as the attacks hit home. He quickly recovered, however, and retaliated with a ravening beam of infernal energy that nearly struck Mo down with a single blow. The cultists advanced and struck at Verity with their long daggers, wounding her, while the demon fired its spikes at Roya. Py managed to catch both Brother Nocturne and several of the cultists in a spray of a caustic concoction.

From here the battle devolved into a wild melee, with Py and Roya engaging the demon in close combat with wrench and rapier while Verity fought the cultists. Mo retreated into invisibility, and Brother Nocturne quickly did likewise before lulling both Verity and the remaining cultists into an enchanted sleep. In response, Mo struck down the cult leader with a ray of fire that burned clear through him. Badly wounded, the demon tried to disengage but Roya ran it through with her blade, and it vanished in a cloud of sulfurous smoke.

To the group's horror, the real Brother Nocturne then revealed himself with mocking applause. He cast off his cult leader guide, revealing himself as a Sherem warlock, and claimed affiliation with the Sixth Tower. The entire cult had been a way to pass the time while preparing for an event called the Great Conjunction, and he thanked the Silverstone Players for tying off the loose ends. In return for that "favor", he warned the Silverstone Players not to be found standing over the corpse of his double, who was the son of the deputy captain of the City Guard. With a final promise that he'd keep an eye on them, "Brother Nocturne" vanished in a burst of flame, as did the walls sealing the chapel both from the rest of the ruins and whatever lies below.

At this final revelation, the Silverstone Players fled, escaping the ruined fortress just as the City Guard began to arrive in force. They split up and returned to the theater by different routes, discarding their cloaks and masks. Before bunkering down for the night, Mo sends his familiar to Cyrene with a message asking for a meeting with her and her mentor.

> Date: [16 Dragon]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures#summer-2258)

The following morning, the Silverstone Players were awoken by Cyrene's arrival. Unfortunately, her mentor Ngozi was on a contemplative retreat, and she had little information to share. She was unaware of an event called the Great Conjunction, although "lesser" conjunctions happened semi-frequently, both between the moons in the sky and between the planes of existence. Likewise, she was confused by the claim of a sixth Tower - Cyrene was quite sure from Ngozi's stories that there were only five Towers in Sherem, each a great city in its own right.

Mo also sent a note to Katerine, asking after her following the dissolution of the Black Sepulchre. Unfortunately, she received a response from Katerine's household, saying that the young lady "took a long holiday in the countryside" to "convalesce from an illness".

> Date: [25 Dragon]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures#summer-2258)

While the Silverstone Players are recovering from the subsequent [undead attack on the market]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures/chaos-catacombs), Cyrene's mentor Ngozi asked to speak with them. Having questions of their own, the party agreed to meet with her at the theater. Having heard a second-hand account of their encounter from Cyrene, Ngozi asked the Silverstone Players to share what they had seen and heard in their own words.

She then shared parts of her own tale, revealing that the Sixth Tower was the remnant of a renegade faction that had attempted to conquer the rest of Sherem, first through treachery and then with an army of demons and devils. Ngozi herself was originally from that now-destroyed city, although she had no sympathies for the diabolists who still carried that banner.

On the topic of the Great Conjunction, even the elder astrologian could offer little insight. Although the three moons Virtus, Malus and Mortis travel steadily through the sky, the wild moon Primus moves unpredictably. While a great conjunction of all four moons is possible, even she could not foresee it more than a few months in advance. Those astrologians who tried to puzzle out the reason for the moon's path have either given up or been driven mad. Ngozi did warn that the moons, the planes, and the arcana of magic are all connected; such an alignment could be a source of incredible power in the wrong hands.
