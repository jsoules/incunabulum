  Cyrene from a dark alternate future recruits the Silverstone Players to
  protect the Four Immortals on their first delve.

As the Silverstone Players enjoyed a quiet evening after the events of Chaos in the Catacombs, a rift in space and time tears open before their eyes. Behind it stands Cyrene, but not the faithful companion they know - this Cyrene is visibly older, bearing scars on both body and spirit. "Get in," she tells the Silverstone Players. "It's about time."

The party steps through the rift, and the older Cyrene explains that she has been fighting and losing a long war against an enemy she refuses to name. "The more you know about them, the more power they gain over you." She cannot stay for long - the portal uses the enemy's magic against them, and risks drawing their attention. Strangely, this Cyrene has never met the Silverstone Players. Instead, an event on this date in the past changed the stars, and her divinations pointed at the party as having the right connections to restore time to its proper course, although even she does not know what that connection is. When asked how the party will return, older Cyrene merely shakes her head, explaining that if the party is successful, none of these events will ever have happened. With that, Cyrene vanished.

The Silverstone Players emerged to find themselves in the Wellspring of yesteryear, in the year 2180. The city was nought by a few streets huddled by the great fortress at the entrance of the valley. Watchtowers and lines of wooden palisades snake down toward the Great Chasm, manned by soldiers from Lothian. Seeing a group of armed strangers in curious garb, the locals direct the party to the local delver's hangout, the Last Stop Inn. There, they meet another band of adventurers preparing for their first delve together. They call themselves the Five Immortals: Vistra Silverstone the dwarvish wizard, Ulmo Appleblossom the halfling rogue, Gentle Riardon the high elf cleric, Luciana Savindar the human fighter, and Left-Handed Hans the half-elf bard. The Silverstone Players (Vistra Silverstone notes that is an odd coincidence) offer to join them.

On the way down toward the Great Chasm, Verity hangs back to talk with Left-Handed Hans, finding the bard to be surprisingly charming. However, their conversation is interrupted as a pair of wyverns fly up out of the Great Chasm, scattering the soldiers at the barricades. Both the Five Immortals and the Silverstone Players engage the wyverns with spells and arrows; Vistra incants a signature spell conjuring a burst of stone daggers in mid-air, driving one wyvern to the ground in time for Luciana to drive it from the soldiers with a borrowed long spear. The second wyvern dives and spits poison, only to be driven off by Verity's mental magics. Roya advanced to skirmish with the landed wyvern. A barrage of crossbow bolts from Py and fiery magic from Mo stagger the beast, allowing Luciana to bring it down with a throw of her spear. Throughout the battle, Hans continued to play, assisting the groups coordination - oddly, though, both Py and Mo were interrupted by ill-timed notes from the bard.

As the combined parties begin their journey beneath the earth, they mingle together. Mo and Vistra bond over spells, while Roya talked with her fellow rogue Ulmo, Verity with Luciana and Py with the bard Hans. Together, the groups battled a pair of displacer beasts, followed by a band of voracious ratlings "lead" by a flaming skull. Finally, they reached the destination of the delve, a well-known chamber known as the Gallery of Ruined Gates.

Here, Left-Handed Hans showed his true colours. As the rest of the Immortals spread out to look at the famed Gallery, Hans remained behind; suspicious, Mo cast a spell to sense magic, finding that Hans was channeling a powerful effect of both Conjuration and a spell school Mo was entirely unfamiliar with. As Mo called out a warning, more rifts appeared around Hans, spewing grotesque star spawn into the chamber.

Hans proclaimed that "it" will only let him die when "she" is dead, throwing a pair of daggers at Vistra Silverstone, who takes one hit and then nearly collapses from a psychic attack. Py and Luciana engaged the star spawn with wrench and sword, while Roya and Riordan closed with Hans, Roya trying to throw her cloak over the possessed bard only for him to be pulled out of the way by an unseen force. Verity used a bardic trick of her own to throw off Hans's timing and then bound him in place with an enchantment, only for tentacles to erupt from his mouth and grasp onto Riordan. At the same time both Riordan and Roya are struck by a paralyzing mental attack, filling their minds with impossible nightmares.

Another rift forms atop Ulmo and Vistra, causing both to flee in supernatural fear which Py is able to counter. Mo strikes Hans with fiery rays, allowing Roya to break free of the nightmares and cut the stunned Riordan free of the writhing tentacles, pulling him safely away from Hans. With the possessed bard all alone, Mo follows up with an explosive fireball, and Vistra delivered the mercy strike in the form of a giant spike of stone up from the ground.

With Hans (or the creature wearing his face) dead, the gallery fell silent once again. The Silverstone Players had little chance to celebrate their victory, however, as within moments reality itself seemed to twist and shatter around them...

The Silverstone Players enjoyed a quiet evening after the events of Chaos in the Catacombs. Nothing of particular note occurred, although each had a vague sense that something important had been forgotten.
