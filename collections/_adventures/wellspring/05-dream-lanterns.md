Verity is contacted by Myria Quill, editor of the *Wellspring Watchman*, who asks Verity to interview a local woman on her new enchanted device. At the Watchman's offices, she is introduced to her interview subject, one Margritte Gramont. Margritte is a human woman approaching middle age, wife of a local shipping magnate; she makes extensive use of cosmetic glamours, lending her a fey appearance.

In contrast to Verity's dogged scepticism, Margritte waxed rhapsodic about her new device, called a Dream Lantern. Simply by setting the lantern by the side of the bed at night, Margritte was able to turn a lifetime of nightmares into dreamless sleep. That said, the circumstances were certainly suspicious - Margritte was unwilling to share just where she had gotten the lantern, saying it was through a referral from "a friend of a friend". The only other detail she could recall is that her instructions were to ensure she was the first one to open the lantern, to ensure that it bonded properly to her.

Unsettled, Verity returned after the interview to the Silverstone Theater and consulted with Mo regarding her knowledge of dream magic. Mo only recalled that certain creatures were known to interact with dreamss, mostly aberrant psionicists such as Mind Flayers.

The following day, the Silverstone Players split up to canvass their various contacts. Py reached out to Richart the nephew of the copper trader and Lavinia the alchemist; neither were aware of a new entity manufacturing magical items. Lavinia added that potions for calming dreams were rare and unreliable, more herbs and fairy magic than proper alchemy.

Mo inquired with his contacts at the Arcane Order. While she was unable to learn more about the Dream Lanterns nor their mysterious creators, she was approached by Ebard Skolnikos, a fellow student of some acquaintance. Ebard asked if Mo had found any unrefined magicite during her adventures, and suggested that he had a contact who was buying magicite under the table, no questions asked.

Roya made the long journey up the mountain to the Celestial Observatory, where she met Cyrene in a meditative garden that featured rolling stone orbs representing the four moons. Cyrene was initially excited, asking if the theater was in danger again, or if the Silverstone Players were preparing to go on a delve. When asked about dream magic, however, she became uncharacteristically closed off. Dream magic was very dangerous, allowing a skilled practitioner to access and manipulate the subconscious mind.

Worse, the study of dream magic in any form was forbidden among the Watchers of the Stars. Cyrene related a story from a few decades back of a full Astrologian that tried to use dream magic to predict the motions of the moons. That sister vanished so thoroughly that no memory of her remained - only an empty office with a handful of partially burned notes, and an apprentice who had no memory of learning from a mentor.

Verity's interview appeared in the Watchman as part of a larger profile on Margritte and her husband. None of the skepticism or caveats made it into the published article. The Silverstone Players discuss the possibilities, with Roya suggesting the connection with a shadowy noble cabal implies the involvement of Brother Nocturne once again. Py and Verity discuss the possible connection to fairy magic, which Roya recalls can often involve enchanted sleep.

With none of the group conversant in the magic of the Wild arcanum, the party reached out to the Delver's Guild. Asking their usual contact Mialee, she suggested that the local experts on fairy magic would be the druidic circles living deep in the Bronzewood. Unfortunately, they would need a guide, and none was presently available, although she would happily forward on the party's information if one should come through. Roya recalled that some of her relatives lived in or traveled to and from the halfling communities in the Bronzewood, and might serve as an intermediate step.

While at the Delver's Guild, the party also inquired about open contracts. While most were of little interest, such as hunting monsters in the Undercity, the party did accept a contract from a giant from the nearby Choir of Shaped Stone. The giant, an aspiring runesmith, wished for an escort within a few tendays to visit the Gallery of Ruined Gates and study the works of her ancient ancestors.

As the sun touched the peaks high above Wellspring, the Silverstone Players set out to the Bronzewood in search of the druids. The morning is spent travelling down Wellspring Vale, the long valley that slopes down from the city to the lowlands. They passed through a patchwork of farms, orchards, small villages, and coppiced trees, and saw work crews digging a canal to link Wellspring with the capital.

Shortly after midday, they turned off the main road and headed north, following the path to the Bronzewood. The ancient forest half-filled a valley of its own, looking deceptively small but growing larger the farther in one travels. They reached the edge of the trees as the sun is going down, and decided to stay at a rustic-looking tavern called the Old Saw Inn.

The inn was fairly busy, and the party split up to speak to different groups. Py approached a group of trappers, who decided to prank the city folk with tales of "Grenchlers", invisible six-legged lizards that are warded off by whistling and putting foot lotion behind the ears. Py also asked them about visiting the druids, but the trappers never ventured that far into the woods. They also mentioned a treaty with the elves.

Mo talked to a pair of wood elves, named Sunlight Through The Leaves and The First Snowflake Of Winter. They warned that finding the druids would be a very difficult journey for city folk; the druids live even deeper into the forest than the elves, close to the boundaries of the fey realms. The two elves strongly recommended that Mo not attempt the journey without an experienced guide. They also expressed surprise that the fey woudl meddle in city affairs, and suggested that a mortal practitioner might be responsible.

Inquiring about the treaty, Mo is told that the druids use nature magic to make the whole valley fertile, and with the elves prevent dangerous creatures from wandering in from the deep woods or the fey realms. In exchange, no tree or animal is to be harmed beyond the Treaty Stones. Mo accepted an offer of berry wine, only to find the wine magically fortified and herself quite intoxicated.

Verity spoke to the two inkeepers, Mika and Michel, who were surprisingly not twins despite their close resemblance. The two aren't sure if the druids are real, but suggest that she could probably find a practitioner of nature magic in any decent-size community in the Bronzewood. Thinking of her missing family, Verity also asked about stories of travellers wandering into (and more importantly, back out of) the deep woods. The two recalled that the old owner user to tell stories of fair folk travelling through long ago, but if those were more than stories the fey have long since stopped coming to visit.

> Date: [17 Unicorn]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures#autumn-2258)

The following morning, the party reconvened and shared stories. Mo struggled to be patient during her hangover with Py's naivete over the "Grenchlers". Roya in turn was furious, both on behalf of her friend and out of wounded professional pride - as a guide, telling that sort of tall tale to impressionable travellers deeply offended her. She asked Py to fashion her a pair of stilts, while she gathered curved sticks that looked like a supposed "grenchler's" teeth. Waiting for the party of trappers to depart, she used her wind magic to hide herself from sight, then scared the group witless with a masterful impression of the imaginary creatures.

With Py's credulity avenged, the Silverstone Players continued on into the Bronzewood. Around midday, Mo spotted a lone figure with a heavy axe pacing back and forth by the side of the road ahead. Although concerned, the party approached openly, and the man half-ran down the hill to meet them. Seeing that the travellers were well-armed, he introduced himself as Pierre the woodman, and asked them for help fighting a trio of giant-kin that had besieged his logging camp. The other loggers had distracted them long enough for Pierre to run for help, but he did not know how long the palisade would hold.

The Silverstone Players agreed to assist, and asked Pierre some questions as he led the party off the road. Pierre was from Wismar, in the Free Cities; his group of woodcutters made camp in the same place each season, looking for golden oak trees. Golden oak wood appeared to have veins of metallic gold running along the grain of the wood, and was highly prized for furniture making. This year there were six other woodcutters in the group, lead by the half-elf Ameé.

As the group approached the woodcutters' camp, Mo sent her familiar Sophie to scout ahead, finding a low hill ringed by a damaged log palisade. One dead ettin giant-kin had fallen at the foot of the walls, festooned with elvish arrows. Two more stood arguing in broken giantish under the trees nearby; the gist of the dispute seemed to be "wooden hill strong" against "meat inside, must crush". Pierre warned that none of their weapons would pierce the giant-kins' hides; still, the party agreed that the ettins must be killed or driven off.

Thus resolved, Mo and Py advanced to within range of spell and crossbow, while Verity crept close enough to lay a laughing curse on one of the giant-kin. Unfortunately, Roya's attempt to strike the ettins from above ended in disaster, falling from a tree nearly on top of the surprised monsters. With one ettin laughing helplessly on the ground, the party launched a volley of spells and crossbow bolts at the other. Roya used the distraction to land a precise blow with her rapier, while Mo used her divination magic to manipulate probability and keep the trapped giant-kin from breaking the laughing curse. However, the wounded ettin retaliated with mighty swings of its stolen axe, striking Roya several times. Verity attempted to enchant the giant-kin, but failed in the face of its berserker rage. Mo struck it with a barrage of fire magic. Finally having enough, the ettin struck Roya one final time before it turned and lumbered into the forest.

Verity advanced forward to heal Roya, while Py launched another volley of crossbow bolts at the fleeing giant-kin, bringing it down with a bolt to the back of its head. With the other ettin still afflicted by Verity's curse, both Roya and Verity landed telling blows with their rapiers, finally breaking the enchantment. Mo struck the giant-kin with several bolts of flame as it regained its feet. It then stomped its foot hard enough to shake the ground, but both Roya and Verity managed to stay on their feet. Verity took a blow from its clubs but retaliated with a fear curse, prompting the ttin to flee in terror and take blows from both Verity and Roya. A final pair of bolts from Py's crossbow brought the second ettin down for good.

Pierre invited the Silverstone Players inside the palisade. The leader, a half-elf named Ameé, thanked the group for their aid, and introduced them to a pair of wood elves that had also come to the group's assistance, bringing down the first of the three ettins. Mo spoke to the two, named "A Leaf Dances On The Breeze" and "Water In The Bubbling Brook", with the former translating the latter's signing. The two warned that it is difficult to reach the druids in the deep woods without an invitation and a guide; the routes change often. However, most local communities will have a greenmage or spirit speaker, who might be able to help them with their questions about fairy magic. While Py spoke to the foresters, Verity also spoke with the elves, asking about people who vanished into the fey realms. She was warned that those who travel too far unprepared to not return. Finally, the party asked the pair about the Treaty Stones. The elves explained that no two of the stones are alike - some rise about the trees, and others are nestled under tree roots. However, the character of the wood changes unmistakably on the far side of the stones.

The Silverstone Players take advantage of the fortification to rest and recover some of their strength. As they prepare to resume their journey, Ameé thanks them again and gives them a small clay pot holding a *potion of treant strength*. Not too long after returning to the road, they turn off once again to follow a stream toward their destination, the halfling village of Shadepool.

The party arrive at Shadepool that evening. The community is quite a sight, built around a large earthen dam. The local undine (halflings with a water bloodline) live in the reservoir, while the gnomes (halflings with an earth bloodline) and a handful of others live in sturdy cottages or burrows in the surrounding hills. Strangely, there was a large area cleared of trees beside the reservoir, with a few temporary buildings going up beside it.

The Silverstone Players were greeted by Orryn, the shirrif of Shadepool. He told them that if they are there for the carnival, they are a month too early. Confused, they were handed a flyer, beautifully hand-illustrated and bearing the invitation "Mister Witch and Mister Light invite you to their carnival of magic and mystery, whimsy and wonder." The name strike a chord with Py, who recalled from her youth that the Witchlight Carnival is famous (or infamous) among the travelling folk, visiting any part of world only once every eight years. She had a very vague memory of seeing it once as a child, but the recollection is hazy and dreamlike.

While fascinating, the carnival was not the reason for the group's visit, and at Roya's request the group was lead to the house of her great-aunt Verna, who works as the local apothecary. Her house was a crooked multi-level cottage; each of the three floors was tilted a different direction, and the chimney intermittently puffed a purple smoke. Great-Aunt Verna welcomed Roya and the rest of the group inside, although the halfling-sized dwelling was a little uncomfortable for the rest of the Silverstone Players. When asked about the carnival visiting, Verna suggested the party speak to the town's council.

The Silverstone Players were served a dinner of watercress soup and fresh bread, but right before Py took a sip an eyeball floated to the top of her bowl. As she stared at it in shock, the eyeball suddenly burst into a flock of rainbow butterflies that scattered about the room before evaporating. Exasperated, Verna stomped up the stairs to grab her wife Euphemia and drag her into the dining room with a few well-placed whacks with the soup ladle. Euphemia introduced herself as a greenmage, a scholar and practioner of nature and fairy magic. Puffing her pipe (which blew spiraling multi-colored smoke), she asked why the group had come to visit.

The party prevaricated, making vague claims about fairy magic at work in Wellspring and their responsibility as members of the Delver's Guild to keep the city safe. When they gave a few details, Euphemia was deeply alarmed by the reference to dream magic at work. She warned that magic involving dreams can be insidiously dangerous, but any number of things can cause nightmares - curses, possession, even indigestion. The greenmage shared a story about a local who was possessed by an astral parasite that caused terrible nightmares; fortunately, a circle of druids was able to drive it out. Regarding the dream lanterns specifically, she asked an intriguing question: "Where are the dreams going?" However, magical artifacts were not her area of study, and perhaps more answers could be found in the city.

Knowing that Verity had questions of her own, Py grabbed Mo and asked Roya to show them around the gardens. Now alone with the greenmage and apothecary, Verity asked her own questions about people disappearing into the fey realms and shared some of the story of her brother Honor and his journal. Euphemia warned that the Feywild had many dangers; if Honor had indeed made a bargain with some denizen, it could serve as a powerful protection but also leave him trapped.

The following morning, the Silverstone Players debating their next move. Verity asked about continuing on to visit the druids, but the party was advised that was a journey that could potentially take several tendays - they might be able to return before the carnival arrived, but they would have to abandon their task in Wellspring to escort a giant below the city. They resolved to return to Wellspring for the time being, and hopefully return in time for the Witchlight Carnival.

Before departing, the party had a few more questions for Verna and Euphemia. There are no easier ways to travel back and forth between Shadepool or Wellspring - as Verna pointed out, if they wanted to be closer to the city, they'd live there. On the topic of practitioners of dream magic, they were told that no two dabblers were alike. That being said, dream magic had a corrosive effect on the mind. Those affected could sometimes act as if there were multiple people in their heads, lose time, or even start to fade from the memories of people around them. If they suspected the use of dream magic, Euphemia strongly suggested they write everything down.

The Silverstone Players also inquired about the Witchlight Carnival, and were directed to a member of the Shadepool's town council, an undine named Pearl. She shared some charming details - apparently, the emissary from the carnival had arrived in town on the back of a giant swan carrying a howdah. She also mentioned offhand that space was cleared by Euphemia, who literally sang the trees out of the ground to create a large enough clearing.

Getting back on the road, the party makes it back to the Old Saw Inn that evening. The innkeeps Mika and Michel have a mixed reaction to the coming carnival, with Mika indifferent but Michel excited at the chance. Also staying at the inn is a trade caravan making a stop in the Bronzewood on its way between Lothian (the capital) and Wellspring. Py strikes up a conversation with the caravan master, who tells her he is carrying fine woodwork and textiles from the Free Cities, and is looking to exchange some spices for fresh foods from the local communities. He also has a crate of religious icons he picked up from an eccentric contact in the capital, and invited Py to take a look the following morning.

> Date: [19 Unicorn]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures#autumn-2258)

As promised, Py looks over the caravan's goods. The woodwork and textiles are much too expensive for theater work, but the religious objects are of more interest. Most are either simple carvings or gaudy trinkets meant to look authentic, but Py picked out three items of interest. First was a stamped iron plate with a toothed wheel, which the merchant claimed had been forged by a high priest of the Mother of Machines in the Free City of Gerlon. Second was a simple silver pendant shaped like an open book, the symbol of the Librarian. Third was what the merchant claimed was a genuine holy relic, a small square of leather said to be part of a scabbord wielded by a famous paladin of the Knight-Errant. Mo quietly cast a spell to detect magic, and at her urging Py also added a simple-looking carved wooden acorn, which radiated a faint aura of transmutation magic.

The caravan and Silverstone Players parted ways, and the journey back to Wellspring was tiring but un-eventful.

> Date: [20 Unicorn]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures#autumn-2258)

The following morning was a rest day in Wellspring, and the streets were busy with shoppers and revelers, including a parade of people flying kites shaped like crimson fish. Shortly before noon, a visitor arrived for Py - it was Brother Lucian, for whom she crafted and repaired simple prosthetics for those in need. While Py worked on repairing a damaged prosthetic he had brought, Brother Lucian mentioned that several of the city's well-to-do citizens had come by the clinic, seeking help for their waking nightmares.

One of the patients was so afflicted that she was sheltering in the clinic's back room, unable to sleep and seeing things moving in the corner of her eyes. Brother Lucian found himself at something of a loss - she was not afflicted by any sort of disease or poison that he could identify, nor was she subject to a curse. Oddly enough, she kept asking him for a lantern, despite the fact that the room was brightly lit. Brother Lucian asked Py and her friends to let him know if they heard of any similar cases, or anything that could help the poor soul in his charge.

The priest also took a look at the religious symbols Py had purchased, having something of an academic interest in the "false" deities of the pantheon despite his faith in the Sun Goddess. Before he left, Py asked if they could visit the patient at the clinic, to which Brother Lucian assented so long as the patient was willing to receive company.

After Brother Lucian departed, the Silverstone Players discussed their options and decided to split up and consult with their various contacts in the city. Py and Roya set out towards Brother Lucian's clinic, while Mo headed to the Arcane Order to investigate the magicite black market and Verity went to solicit a follow-up interview with Margritte Gramont.

The clinic was a sturdy building of whitewashed stone, built in a run-down part of Wellspring's Old City district and festooned with bright golden symbols of the Sun Goddess. Py and Roya were quickly welcomed inside, and while Py started to set up her tools Brother Lucian went to check on his patient. He returned a minute later, and announced with alarm, "She's gone!" He lead Py and Roya to a storeroom at the back of the clinic; as they walked, Roya asked if the woman had left anything behind, to which Brother Lucian replied that she had left her clothes and cloak, and was wearing a set of borrowed acolyte robes.

The storeroom was something of a mess; the window was broken out, with a battered chair on its side at the window's base. A strange symbol was crudely scribed on the wall in yellow paint, looking like an opened eye surrounded by a multi-tailed spiral. Some investigation revealed additional details: the window had clearly been broken out from the inside. There was a discarded can of yellow paint behind an overturned bench, and a discarded rag with a smear of yellow paint. Based on how dry the paint was, the symbol had been inscribed several hours before, likely shortly after Brother Lucian had left to visit the Silverstone Theater. Finally, outside the window was a narrow alley, with visible footprints in the discarded refuse. Unfortunately, the trail was lost once it rejoined the busy street beyond.

Looking at the symbol itself, Brother Lucian was unable to identify its origins despite his extensive knowledge of religious iconography. Py and Roya decided to make a copy and take it to the Delver's Guild, in the hopes that someone could identify it.

Meanwhile, Mo found his "buddy" Ebard celebrating his good fortune at the Pointed Cap, traditional apprentice's hangout near the Arcane Order. As he ordered Mo an Everburning Flask cocktail, the clearly intoxicated Ebard happily answered Mo's questions. He had made a sizeable amount of gold brokering the sale of magicite to the Harfoot Syndicate, with whom he had previously had a relationship selling stolen potion ingredients. Mo pretended to drink her own cocktail, earning a dirty look from Pierre the tiefling bartender, while Ebard knocked his back and ordered something green. Served a Lamia's Kiss, Ebard continued that his contact with the syndicate was named Portia, although the last name escaped him. It was something like "Dumbthistle", or "Downthistle"; something night-related and something plant-related.

With that, Ebard blacked out. Mo dragged him to a booth and took the chance to search her fellow student's pockets, finding a small coin pouch along with an answer sheet for an upcoming quiz. On the back of the answer sheet was a cryptic note, including a date (the 22nd of Unicorn, two days hence), a time (two bells before midnight), and the word fragment "-under".

As Py and Roya went to the clinic and Mo to the Arcane Order, Verity headed to Margritte's townhouse in the Garden District. She introduced herself to the footman, stating that she wanted to a follow up on her previous story; after a few minutes, she was invited inside to the salon, where she found Margritte artfully draped over one of the couches. The woman stated her appreciation for Verity's profile in the *Watchman*, and was happy to answer her follow up questions.

Verity's keen eyes noticed that despite her apparent ease, Margritte had bags under her eyes that were incompletely covered over by cosmetic glamours. When pressed, Margritte admitted that she'd started to have nightmares again. However, the nightmares had changed - now she saw shapeless figures around the edges of her vision, or an impression of nameless things watching her through the walls. When she asked about a second lantern, she was told the enchantments would conflict.

At this point, Margritte apologized for being a poor host, and offered Verity refreshments. She accepted, and also asked if she could see the lantern for herself. At Verity's request, the socialite brought the lantern down from her bedroom. The lantern was just short of a foot tall, composed of delicate bronze and frosted glass. One side of the lantern was hinged. Otherwise, the lantern seemed fairly mundane; pointedly so, and it tended to slip beneath notice unless actively concentrated upon.

Verity asked a few follow up questions of Margritte. The socialite had purchased the lantern at a salon held by one of her friends, who had requested anonymity. She doesn't know who else from her social circle might have bought a lantern. She does recall, however, that she was told no less an august personage than Dame Savindar had purchased one of the artifacts.

Meanwhile, Py and Roya continued on to the Delver's Guild. While their usual contact Mialee is out, they find the archivist Morana Durthane nursing an ale at a table half-covered with parchment; she was happy to answer a few questions as a distraction from dealing with old accounting records. When shown the symbol from the clinic, however, the archivist was unfamiliar with it, and suggested talking to the Arcane Order if the party suspected the symbol might be magical in origin. She also pointed out that the party could place a bounty on the guild board in search of more information.

While still at the Delver's Guild, Roya also asked about maps to the everchanging terrain beneath the city, with her eye on the upcoming contract to escort a giant to the Gallery of Ruined Gates. Unfortunately, the recent upwelling had scrambled the local topography; Morana suggested trying again in a tenday, when more delving parties had reported back.

The Silverstone Players reconvened that evening and shared their stories. Concerned that Dame Savindar might be affected by her lantern, Verity sent her a cryptic note via the Delver's Guild:

> We urgently need to talk. You're in danger. Under no circumstances should you open the lantern.
>
> -- Verity of the Silverstone Players

Meanwhile, Mo sent her familiar with a message to Cyrene at the Astral Observatory:

> Update on the matter we discussed most recently. Is this symbol familiar? Let us know when we can meet.

The Silverstone Players then departed together to the Arcane Order to consult with one of Mo's instructors, Professor Wim Spence. They found the professor having a nightcap "to warm his old bones", but he was happy to answer some questions for one of his favorite students.

While the professor was unfamiliar with the symbol itself, he suggested that both the opened eye and the spiral are related to mind magic in traditional symbology. Given the context of a traumatized young woman, he suggested that the symbol could either be generated by the experience itself, or something that the person saw and associated with the trauma. Unfortunately, he suggested that the priest would be better able than he to identify a curse, a poisoning, or demonic possession. As for other types of possession, Professor Spence recalled that some creatures were known to influence the mind, such as illithids or so-called mind flayers.

Finally, the party asked about dream magic. While a rare topic of study, the professor recalled that one of his collegues, one Professor Estelle, had studied dream magic perhaps a decade ago. She apparently left the academy some time thereafter. Oddly enough, another student came to him a few months ago, also asking questions about dream magic. The students name was Jasper something-Thistle.
