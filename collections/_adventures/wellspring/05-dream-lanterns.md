Verity is contacted by Myria Quill, editor of the *Wellspring Watchman*, who asks Verity to interview a local woman on her new enchanted device. At the Watchman's offices, she is introduced to her interview subject, one Margritte Gramont. Margritte is a human woman approaching middle age, wife of a local shipping magnate; she makes extensive use of cosmetic glamours, lending her a fey appearance.

In contrast to Verity's dogged scepticism, Margritte waxed rhapsodic about her new device, called a Dream Lantern. Simply by setting the lantern by the side of the bed at night, Margritte was able to turn a lifetime of nightmares into dreamless sleep. That said, the circumstances were certainly suspicious - Margritte was unwilling to share just where she had gotten the lantern, saying it was through a referral from "a friend of a friend". The only other detail she could recall is that her instructions were to ensure she was the first one to open the lantern, to ensure that it bonded properly to her.

Unsettled, Verity returned after the interview to the Silverstone Theater and consulted with Mo regarding her knowledge of dream magic. Mo only recalled that certain creatures were known to interact with dreamss, mostly aberrant psionicists such as Mind Flayers.

The following day, the Silverstone Players split up to canvass their various contacts. Py reached out to Richart the nephew of the copper trader and Lavinia the alchemist; neither were aware of a new entity manufacturing magical items. Lavinia added that potions for calming dreams were rare and unreliable, more herbs and fairy magic than proper alchemy.

Mo inquired with his contacts at the Arcane Order. While she was unable to learn more about the Dream Lanterns nor their mysterious creators, she was approached by Ebard Skolnikos, a fellow student of some acquaintance. Ebard asked if Mo had found any unrefined magicite during her adventures, and suggested that he had a contact who was buying magicite under the table, no questions asked.

Roya made the long journey up the mountain to the Celestial Observatory, where she met Cyrene in a meditative garden that featured rolling stone orbs representing the four moons. Cyrene was initially excited, asking if the theater was in danger again, or if the Silverstone Players were preparing to go on a delve. When asked about dream magic, however, she became uncharacteristically closed off. Dream magic was very dangerous, allowing a skilled practitioner to access and manipulate the subconscious mind.

Worse, the study of dream magic in any form was forbidden among the Watchers of the Stars. Cyrene related a story from a few decades back of a full Astrologian that tried to use dream magic to predict the motions of the moons. That sister vanished so thoroughly that no memory of her remained - only an empty office with a handful of partially burned notes, and an apprentice who had no memory of learning from a mentor.

Verity's interview appeared in the Watchman as part of a larger profile on Margritte and her husband. None of the skepticism or caveats made it into the published article. The Silverstone Players discuss the possibilities, with Roya suggesting the connection with a shadowy noble cabal implies the involvement of Brother Nocturne once again. Py and Verity discuss the possible connection to fairy magic, which Roya recalls can often involve enchanted sleep.

With none of the group conversant in the magic of the Wild arcanum, the party reached out to the Delver's Guild. Asking their usual contact Mialee, she suggested that the local experts on fairy magic would be the druidic circles living deep in the Bronzewood. Unfortunately, they would need a guide, and none was presently available, although she would happily forward on the party's information if one should come through. Roya recalled that some of her relatives lived in or traveled to and from the halfling communities in the Bronzewood, and might serve as an intermediate step.

While at the Delver's Guild, the party also inquired about open contracts. While most were of little interest, such as hunting monsters in the Undercity, the party did accept a contract from a giant from the nearby Choir of Shaped Stone. The giant, an aspiring runesmith, wished for an escort within a few tendays to visit the Gallery of Ruined Gates and study the works of her ancient ancestors.

As the sun touched the peaks high above Wellspring, the Silverstone Players set out to the Bronzewood in search of the druids.
