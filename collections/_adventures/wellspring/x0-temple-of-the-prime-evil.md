Verity tries her hand at writing a horror-comedy starring the Silverstone Players. In it, the party is pursuit of a wicked cult, who are seeking to release the Prime Evil. They track the cultists to a temple in the jungles of Sherem.

Shortly after entering the temple, Mo manages to trigger a poisoned dart trap; unfortunately, the poison was old enough that the effects were hallucinogenic instead. Mo spent the remainder of the adventure seeing frogs.

Heading deeper into the temple, the party entered a large columned gallery lit by skylights. Py investigates a large statue with a strangely saurian appearance, which has a scrap of dark fabric caught in it from a robe or cloak. She also finds many footprints in the dust, leading further into the ruins. Mo attempts to investigate further by casting a *comprehend languages* spell, but her hallucinations caused her to instead hear the voices of her companions as ribbiting, and was unable to break the effect for the remainder of the adventure.

At the end of this gallery, the party came across a makeshift abandoned camp. Unfortunately, they were distracted by Mo's spell misfire and surrounded by cultists. Here Roya stepped up and managed to convince the cultists that the party were late arrivals, and tricked them into a religious observance while the party snuck away deeper into the temple.

The Silverstone Players find themselves in a labyrinth, dotted with ominous altars and torches that burn with an unsettling green glow. Shortly thereafter, a pulse of magic shakes the temple, and the cultists left behind cry out in triumph shortly followed by terror. As they progressed further, they discovered they were being hunted, and were flanked ahead and behind by two pair of raptors.

Mo immediately conjures a phantasmal toad to distract one of the raptors behind, while the other leaps forward and knocks down Verity, following up with a vicious bite, but Roya stands over her fallen comrade and avenges her injury. Meanwhile, the two raptors in front came forward to battle against Py and her steel defender. The construct takes severe damage until Roya comes up to strike down one of the dinosaurs. Wounded by battling an illusory foe and seeing its remaining packmate fall, the last raptor slinks off into the labyrinth.

The Silverstone Players finally reach the heart of the temple, a great vaulted chamber with huge columns on either side and a central skylight festooned with hanging vines. At the far end were a pair of enormous stone doors carved with demonic imagery. Standing in front of that door, the head of the cultists and a handful of wounded survivors finished their dread ritual, and it opened to reveal a towering tyrannosaur that promptly devoured the cultist before stalking into the room. Unfortunately, between the door opening and the great beast's footsteps the corridor behind collapse, trapping the party in the chamber with the hungry titan.

Mo and Verity alternated striking the beast with powerful magics, with Mo's fiery rays scorching the tyrannosaur while Verity's mind magic repeatedly drove it back. Enraged, its tail struck and collapsed one of the chamber's columns, causing rocks to fall upon everyone but Roya, who takes the opportunity to turn invisible and climb upon the great beast's back and bury her rapier in its eye; thrown loose, she used her innate wind magic to glide to a safe landing as the tyrannosaur roared in pain and rage. A final pair of magical blows drove the tyrannosaur back behind the great doors, which trapped the titan out of time behind the magical seals once more.
