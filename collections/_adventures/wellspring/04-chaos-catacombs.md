As the Silverstone Players are recovering from the [battle with Brother Nocturne of the Black Sepulchre]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures/devils-playthings), they are roused by Gunter, a messenger from the Delver's Guild. All available adventurers were called to the Merchant's Quarter to battle an incursion of undead from a previously unknown necropolis beneath the Fortress Ruins. Poor Gunter was a scholar in the archives before being sent out to fetch adventurers, and he shared that no one could recall seeing any references to anything beneath the ruins.

The Silverstone Players conferred while Gunter and Cyrene bonded over tea. There was some debate over compensation; Gunter assured them that the Merchantry Association was even now negotiating terms with the Delver's Guild. Feeling some responsibility, the party agreed to help on two conditions. First, they demanded to see the dossiers on the party that Gunter was carrying. Unfortunately, they had little more than physical descriptions, since the Silverstone Players had not yet completed any official jobs for the Guild. They also wanted to know the best group of delvers in the Guild; according to Gunter, those would be the Runewardens (whom the party had previously met at [Dame Savindar's benefit for the Guild]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures/silverstone-theater-mystery)).

The Silverstone Players set out for the Market District, accompanied by Cyrene (who volunteered her healing services). At the market they were met by Mialee Sylvaranth, their regular contact at the Guild. She assured them that the Merchantry Association was offering both gold and magicite to resolve the situation quickly, and that the City Guard (present in force) had secured the surface, but were refusing to go into the forgotten necropolis.

Before descending into the ruins, the Silverstone Players make some final preparations: Mo and Cyrene each conjure magical armor, while Py applies a boost of artificer magic to Verity's protective gear. The ruined fortress showed signs of heavy fighting - broken weapons, freshly spilled blood, and the mangled remains of the long dead lay scattered in the corridors, while up ahead rang the sounds of fighting and bursts of wind and magical fire. On investigation, Mo recognized the risen dead as ghouls, possessed corpses with paralytic claws and an unnatural hunger for flesh.

A command post was set up in the chapel where the party had previously battled the false Brother Nocturne. Several groups of delvers had already gone ahead, where the catacombs divided into three paths. The rightward path was already cleared, and the central squad advancing in good order; the party assigned to the left path, however, had yet to report back, and the Silverstone Players were asked to assist them.

Cautiously, the party descended into the necropolis, passing row after row of ash-filled urns, piled bones, or whole corpses set to lie in state. As they passed through a larger chamber, however, they were ambushed by a trio of ghouls lead by a larger ghast. While Mo unleashed rays of fire, Verity laid a curse of ill fortune on the undead, and Roya and Py stepped forward to strike them with wrench and rapier under the protection of Py's steel defender. Another fire bolt from Mo strikes down the ghast, and one by one the remaining undead fall to steel and magic.

With their part of the catacombs quiet for now, the Silverstone Players paused to lick their wounds.

<!-- Session Break -->

Resuming their journey forward, the party came across a lone ghoul shambling forward with strange crystalline growths embedded in its head and chest. Mo and Verity struck out with bolts of fire and eldritch blasts, which seemed to resonate strangely with the crystals. Stepping forward, Py and her steel defender halted its advance, and Roya darted ahead to cave in its rotting skull with her rapier, the ghoul nearly falling atop Py. Alarmed, the artificer saw the crystals flashing an uncanny blue light, faster and brighter, and quickly ordered the party to retreat - just in time, as the ghoul exploded in a burst of magic and viscera.

Forging cautiously ahead, they next came across a larger chamber where six passages met. Each passage was guarded by a heavy portcullis waiting to seal the path, save for the lone corridor directly ahead where the portcullis had already fallen. Near the center of the chamber lay the seemingly shattered form of a statue in stone and bronze, perhaps fifteen feet in height and with faint magical traceries still flickering on its surface. At a closer glance, Py recognized the glowing glyphs as similar to Sherem tattoos; Cyrene helpfully added that the statue must have been down in the catacombs since the Sherem Wars.

Hearing ghouls begin to approach from the four side corridors, the party inspected the mechanism for the portcullises and found each damaged or incomplete in some fashion. Py attempted to restore one with a spell of mending; unfortunately, this triggered the rise of the damaged but still deadly Sherem war golem. As ghouls began to stagger into the chamber, the party wisely beat a retreat. Fortunately, the golem did not pursue them into the corridor and even crushed a ghoul that wandered too close, but the party still had to fight a pair of ghouls that had made it past the golem. Roya and Py riddle one with arrows, while Verity detonates a volatile ghoul with an eldritch blast.

Though the immediate danger was past, the way forward was still shut, and the Silverstone Players began to experiment with the golem, now patrolling in a small circle in the chamber. Py crafted a tiny toy that emitted a screaming sound, tying it to an arrow that Roya then threaded through the far portcullis in an attempt to trick the golem into destroying it. Unfortunately, the golem merely paused for a moment and then resumed its patrol.

However, Mo spotted a discarded backpack at the edge of the torchlight beyond the lowered portcullis. Taking a risk, Py leaned on her fey heritage to step through the mists to the far side of the portcullis, where she saw that the mechanism on this side had been sabotaged. Searching the bag for clues, she found a standard delver's pack, with a bedroll, some rope, a collapsible pole, and some shattered ink vials with the ink still wet. Using the collapsible pole, she managed to poke the golem through the portcullis as it strode around the chamber. The war golem stomped over and loomed over Py for a long moment before returning to its circle, allowing Py to take a close look at its construction.

Mo attempted to negotiate with the golem in both the common tongue and the giantish language, to no effect. After much cajoling, Verity convinced Cyrene to try the few words in Sherem that she had heard from her mentor Ngozi; unfortunately, she did not know their meaning, and suspected they might be rather rude. At hearing the Sherem language the golem paused for a moment, as if waiting for instructions. After Mo uses ritual magic to try and decipher the writing on the golem's body, without success, the party decided that the only way forward (and hopefully, to the missing delvers) was through the antique war machine.

Py and Roya entered the chamber once again to tackle the golem head on, while Mo and Verity provided magical support from the archway. Meanwhile, the noise attracted more of the hungry dead, and ghouls began to stagger into the chamber in ones and twos. Py tossed a caustic concoction that splashes the golem and a nearby ghoul, while Mo's fiery rays burned and distracted the golem long enough for Roya to climb into the rafters and trigger a mechanism manually, closing off one of the four side corridors just as more ghouls began to arrive.

Verity blasted several ghouls with her magic, while the golem nearly crushed another, revealing a large unstable crystal within its chest. Mo targeted the crystal with arcane arrows, causing a sizable blast that finally brings the golem down. Py battled the ghouls with alchemy and her trusty wrench, taking several wounds but managing to shake off the paralytic poison on the ghouls' claws, allowing Roya to attempt to unstick another portcullis mechanism by finding the right resonant note.

Mo burned some sort of dessicated cocoon off of another lever, allowing her to seal another side corridor, while Py smashed that last remaining ghoul with a mighty blow of her wrench. Roya and Verity worked together to unstick the resonant lever mechanism, while Mo and Py together repaired the last broken lever, and the Silverstone Players managed to stem the flow of the undead just as another wave was poised to break.

To be concluded...
