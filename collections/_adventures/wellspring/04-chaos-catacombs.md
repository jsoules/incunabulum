As the Silverstone Players are recovering from the [battle with Brother Nocturne of the Black Sepulchre]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures/devils-playthings), they are roused by Gunter, a messenger from the Delver's Guild. All available adventurers were called to the Merchant's Quarter to battle an incursion of undead from a previously unknown necropolis beneath the Fortress Ruins. Poor Gunter was a scholar in the archives before being sent out to fetch adventurers, and he shared that no one could recall seeing any references to anything beneath the ruins.

The Silverstone Players conferred while Gunter and Cyrene bonded over tea. There was some debate over compensation; Gunter assured them that the Merchantry Association was even now negotiating terms with the Delver's Guild. Feeling some responsibility, the party agreed to help on two conditions. First, they demanded to see the dossiers on the party that Gunter was carrying. Unfortunately, they had little more than physical descriptions, since the Silverstone Players had not yet completed any official jobs for the Guild. They also wanted to know the best group of delvers in the Guild; according to Gunter, those would be the Runewardens (whom the party had previously met at [Dame Savindar's benefit for the Guild]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures/silverstone-theater-mystery)).

The Silverstone Players set out for the Market District, accompanied by Cyrene (who volunteered her healing services). At the market they were met by Mialee Sylvaranth, their regular contact at the Guild. She assured them that the Merchantry Association was offering both gold and magicite to resolve the situation quickly, and that the City Guard (present in force) had secured the surface, but were refusing to go into the forgotten necropolis.

Before descending into the ruins, the Silverstone Players make some final preparations: Mo and Cyrene each conjure magical armor, while Py applies a boost of artificer magic to Verity's protective gear. The ruined fortress showed signs of heavy fighting - broken weapons, freshly spilled blood, and the mangled remains of the long dead lay scattered in the corridors, while up ahead rang the sounds of fighting and bursts of wind and magical fire. On investigation, Mo recognized the risen dead as ghasts, possessed corpses with paralytic claws and an unnatural hunger for flesh.

A command post was set up in the chapel where the party had previously battled the false Brother Nocturne. Several groups of delvers had already gone ahead, where the catacombs divided into three paths. The rightward path was already cleared, and the central squad advancing in good order; the party assigned to the left path, however, had yet to report back, and the Silverstone Players were asked to assist them.

Cautiously, the party descended into the necropolis, passing row after row of ash-filled urns, piled bones, or whole corpses set to lie in state. As they passed through a larger chamber, however, they were ambushed by a trio of ghouls lead by a larger ghast. While Mo unleashed rays of fire, Verity laid a curse of ill fortune on the undead, and Roya and Py stepped forward to strike them with wrench and rapier under the protection of Py's steel defender. Another fire bolt from Mo strikes down the ghast, and one by one the remaining undead fall to steel and magic.

To be continued...
