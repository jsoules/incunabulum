Originally a mutual aid society for halfling immigrants to the city, Harfoot Syndicate has become the largest criminal enterprise in Wellspring. Syndicate “houses” are responsible for everything from petty street crime such as pickpockets and flimflam artists to grand theft and running establishments selling companionship or minor narcotics.

The Syndicate is organized into cells known as “houses”, each of which is self-organized and tends to focus on a few areas of criminal or quasi-legitimate enterprise. Few operate in the Upper City, although a connection is rumored between the Syndicate and the gilded Rabbit’s Foot Casino. In the Lower City, “Syndicate goon” is a curse word, although most houses avoid preying directly on the working classes. By contrast, parts of the Undercity are run by the Syndicate more or less openly, and they provide protection to places where the City Guard will not go.
