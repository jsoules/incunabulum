campaign: wellspring
name: The Merchantry Association
slug: merchantry-association
heading: the-merchantry-association
headquarters: |
  The headquarters of the Merchantry Association is an imposing marble edifice in the Civic District of the Upper City. It holds offices and meeting rooms for conducting negotiations of trade and commerce, as well as renting space to some of the smaller constituent organizations and guilds.
membership: |
  Membership in the Association is theoretically voluntary; there is an annual membership fee that is supposed to be offset by tax advantages, although in practice individuals and smaller businesses gain little advantage from the latter arrangement. Particularly in the Lower City, there are occasional claims of threats or thuggery against independents who refuse to join the Merchantry Association, although these claims are rarely substantiated when investigated by the City Guard.
relationships: |
  The Merchantry Association has a cozy relationship with the City Guard, and often hires members of the guard for security for itself and the more well-connected of its constituency. Conversely, it has a politely combative relationship with the Arcane Order; the membership resents the sky-high prices charged for magical services, while the Merchantry leadership would love nothing more than to bring the Arcane Order (and its associated fees) under the Association banner.

The Merchantry Association represents the tradespeople of Wellspring, from an independent craftman in the Lower City to the great trading companies. At least, that is the sales pitch, although there are frequent complaints that the Association is far more representative of (and responsive to) the great companies and constitutent guilds than it is to its individual members.

A number of guilds and trade organizations fall under the umbrella of the Merchantry Association, of which the most prominent is the Banking Guild.
