campaign: wellspring
name: The Delver's Guild
slug: delvers-guild
headquarters: |
  The headquarters of the Delver’s Guild is located in the Trades District of the Lower City. Originally just an inn bought out by a group of retired adventurers, it has grown into a sprawling complex of offices, warehouses, markets, and training grounds, but the heart of the guild remains the old taproom of the Last Stop.
membership: |
  Membership in the Guild requires a nominal fee, mostly to ensure that new adventurers have the resources necessary to survive their first sojourn. Lower-level adventurers benefit the most from the guild’s services, while mid-level adventurers often use the guild as brokers to find those with the resources to hire their services or purchase the treasures found in the depths.
relationships: |
  The Delver’s Guild has generally good relationship with most others in the city. It has something of a love-hate relationship with the City Guard, who view delvers as disreputable at best but rely on their spells and steel when dangerous creatures emerge from the Chasm.
services: |
  One of the most important services provided by the guild is a form of insurance. Adventurers can register a delve with the guild, including a planned path and expected date of return. If they fail to return, the guild will send a more experienced party to investigate. This serves two purposes - the promise of rescue can turn an otherwise hopeless situation into a fortified standoff for the lost party, as well as removing a potential danger to other adventurers or even to the city itself. In exchange, a rescued party will often pay a surcharge on guild services for a time, or have a portion of guild contracts garnished, but most adventurers consider this money very well spent indeed.

  Another key service is the bounty board, which matches adventuring parties with quests or assignments paid by fellow adventurers or on behalf of others in the city. These can range from “retrieve my favorite bow from the Gallery of Forlorn Notes”, to “recover the hide of a cloaker from the Crystal Caverns”, to “kill the mutant troll-kin last seen wandering near the underground fighting arenas”. The guild takes a cut of each commission, which provides the bulk of its funding.

  The guild also provides a marketplace for buying and selling basic equipment, and has contacts for most needs including high-quality weapons and armor, consumable items such as scrolls or potions, or even commissioning magical items. The guild can also provide a contact for selling discovered magic, rare materials or antiquities.

  Finally, the guild provides training and mentorship for a fee. Members can learn how to use new weapons or to fight in heavier armor, or to develop proficiency in new skills, tools, or languages. More advanced abilities can also be trained, but this often requires a task or favor rather than gold.

Founded by a group of retired adventurers, including Dame Savindar, the Delver’s Guild is a cross between a trade union and a mutual aid society for those who take on the dangers of the deeps beneath the city. The Guild provides a single point of contact between the notoriously unpredictable adventurers and the institutions of Wellspring.
