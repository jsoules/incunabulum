Originally an idle venture by gentlemen of leisure, the Brotherhood of Planar Cartographers seeks to explore and chart the manifold planes of existence. They are particularly interested in sightings of extraplanar creatures or of working or unmapped gates. Their headquarters is a former hunting lodge and exclusive house of ill repute in the Upper City.
