slug: watchers-of-the-stars
heading: the-watchers-of-the-stars
headquarters: |
  The headquarters of the Watchers is the Astral Observatory, built into a peak high above the City of Wellspring. Although an arduous climb, the Observatory grants an unparalleled view of the city and an unobstructed view of the heavens.
membership: |
  Lay members of the order are known simply as Watchers, but more highly ranked adepts who can learn the secret magics are called Astrologians. Astrologians can be recognized by their blindfolds and robes with the patterns of the constellations. Most adventurers who affiliate with the Watchers have some form of magic, and are most commonly wizards, or clerics with domains of knowledge or prophesy.
relationships: |
  The Watchers endure a somewhat one-sided rivalry with the Arcane Order, who they see as narrow-minded and focused on commerce and influence over the mysteries of magic. That said, a few Watchers are also guild members in good standing, including several high-ranking Astrologians. The Watchers of the Stars also have a dedicated monastic order, the Falling Stars, responsible for protection of the Astral Observatory and (rarely) individual members.

The Watchers of the Stars are an organization of diviners, scholars and mystics who study the heavens for glimpses of the future. It is said that they master magics unknown to other mages, and that their most powerful adepts can use their knowledge to manipulate the vagaries of fate.

In Wellspring, the Watchers provide an invaluable service, predicing when surges of magic from the Great Chasm will erupt. They are viewed by awe and respect by many, but fear and distrust by others, especially those who have lost people or livelihoods to sudden surges of magic and the accompanying monsters.
