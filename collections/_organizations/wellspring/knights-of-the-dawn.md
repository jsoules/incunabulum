An order of paladins dedicated to the [Sun Goddess]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/religion#light-and-darkness), sworn to oppose darkness in all its forms. The Knights of the Dawn are affiliated with the Church of Light, although the knightly order predates that sect of the faith by several centuries, and the paladins maintain their own command hierarchy.

The Knights are organized into local chapters, each of which has a Chapterhouse as its headquarters. Local chapters have considerable autonomy, both from the order as a whole and from their patrons in the Church of Light. Of particular note is a growing schism within the order regarding that relationship, with some of the more ecumenical chapters rejecting the divine war framing of the Church and emphasizing the role of paladin as healer and protector of all. These chapters frequently maintain their own shrines and temples and even seminaries to pass on the older, more inclusive tenets of the faith.
