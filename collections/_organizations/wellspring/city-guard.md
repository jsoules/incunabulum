The City Guard is responsible for protecting the city from disorder, invasion, insurrection, and the constant threat of monsters from the Great Chasm. The guard patrols the Upper City and maintains a regular presence in most of the Lower City, but rarely venture in the Undercity (and then only in force). Although the City Guard is responsible for crime and maintains the cityâ€™s gaol and prison (known as The Pits), the guard is not an investigative service, and those trying to track down missing people or stolen property are advised to find a private investigator.
