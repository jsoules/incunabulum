headquarters: |
  The headquarters of the Arcane Order is a grand edifice of marble in the Garden District of the Upper City, with a fortified tower jutting out over the edge of the Great Chasm. In addition to the great library, it holds the offices of the guild’s leadership, laboratories of the arcane arts, and (it is claimed) vaults filled with powerful enchanted artifacts.
membership: |
  The Arcane Order restricts its membership to those capable of casting arcane magic. Members also must pay yearly dues, give the guild a percentage of earnings on sales of magical items or services, and can be required to lend their magic to the guild for ritual magic or the defense of the city. In return, the Arcane Order grants access to their unparalleled library, offers tutoring and mentorship from more senior arcanists (usually for a price), and access to lucrative opportunities from the wealthy and well-connected of the city.
relationships: |
  The Arcane Order comes into occasional conflict with the Watchers of the Stars, seeking to bring the more mystically-inclined Watchers under the aegis (and membership dues) of the guild.

Formally known as the Fraternal Order of the Arcane, the Arcane Order is a guild of wizards, sorcerers and mages. Their library of spells is said to be without equal, and their combined magical might is without question.

In Wellspring, the Arcane Order maintains many of the magical defenses of the city, and its membership is often on the front lines when surges of monsters arise from the deeps. When not protecting the city (a task, to be clear, for which the guild is paid an exorbitant sum), guild wizards are seen as haughty or arrogant, even by the standards of wizards. Their fees for common services are also a frequent cause for complaint among the city’s merchantry.
