A radical offshoot of [a dyadic halfling faith from across the sea]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/religion#light-and-darkness), the Church of Light preaches that all are foot soldiers in a grand war against the forces of Evil. Unusually, the Church is more or less monotheistic, worshipping the Sun Goddess alone and declaring that all other supposed deities are greater or lesser demons in service to the Lord of Night.
