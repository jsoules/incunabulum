      Ugh, these assholes. Montaigne was expecting them to back his play for the Duchy, and I think they almost did. Bad business all around.

The official guard force of the City of Jewel. Frequently lazy and corrupt, the watch takes orders from the City Council (local nobility and rich merchants). They patrol the Upper City vigorously, kicking out "riffraff" who look like they donâ€™t belong. Conversely, the watch only visits the Docks to "bust some heads", and only in force.
