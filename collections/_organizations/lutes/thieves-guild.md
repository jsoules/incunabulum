Formerly a gang in the Docks of Jewel, their action during the crisis with Merchant Montaigne has allowed them to rise into a position of leadership within the Sapphire Coast’s shadowy underworld. While by no means law-abiding, the Thieves’ Guild ensure that more dangerous groups such as drug smugglers or diabolic cults cannot gain a foothold in Jewel, and are begrudgingly tolerated by the Ducal Guard.
