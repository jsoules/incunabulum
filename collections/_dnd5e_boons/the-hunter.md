You can cast the *hunter’s mark* spell without expending a spell slot. Once you cast the spell in this way, you can’t cast the spell in this way again until you finish a long rest.

You can select this boon multiple times, up to a total number of times equal to one less than your Proficiency Bonus. Each time you do so, you can cast *hunter’s mark* one additional time without expending a spell slot.
