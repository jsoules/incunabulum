Choose one of the following benefits:

- You learn one cantrip of your choice.
- You learn one 1st-level spell of your choice. You can cast this spell without expending a spell slot. Once you cast the spell in this way, you canâ€™t cast the spell in this way again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast the spell using spell slots you have of the appropriate level.

You can select this boon multiple times. Each time you do so, you learn one additional cantrip or 1st-level spell, or gain one additional use of a spell you previously learned.
