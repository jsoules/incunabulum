Parsival is the Keeper of the Library for the Arcane Order, responsible for maintaining its collection of tomes, scrolls, and incunabula (mostly from the apprenties, or so he grouches). Most of the filing work is handled by bound imps; rumors that Parsival tasks those same imps with tormenting students who mistreat or misplace his precious books have so far gone unproven.
