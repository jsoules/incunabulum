Verity Gray is a female human Bard in her early 30s. She was born and raised in the Lower City of Wellspring. Her parents were community organizers and sometime adventurers who loved helping others, hated idleness, and instilled in their children values like solidarity, courage, and persistence in the face of hardship. Verity’s older brother, Honor, embodied all that their parents believed: optimism, kindness, and an endless reservoir of empathy, especially for Verity, who shared none of that idealism. Verity has always been the skeptic and the cynic of the family, to the amusement (rather than chagrin) of her parents. Honor always used to say, “She’ll come around some day.” He was probably right, up until one day when she was 17: her parents took an adventuring contract and never came back. Honor, 20 at the time, tried to scrounge enough money and goodwill to commission a rescue party after them, but no one would take the job. Despite Verity’s desperate pleas, he went after them himself. He never returned either. It’s been more than 15 years, but Verity still hasn’t found him or her parents, and has devoted much of her adult life trying to unravel what happened to her family and why.

Pretty much everyone in the Lower City knows her and loved her family, whose disappearance was among the motivations for the creation of the Delvers’ Guild and its insurance program. There was a time when she was pitied; that time has passed. Verity weaponized her underlying curiosity and grief to uncover the city’s dark secrets. She now works for the various broadsheets (whoever pays the best this month) and is reputed to never print a lie, no matter how ugly the truth. This makes her both well-trusted and not particularly well-liked. Her typical beat is politics, corruption, murder, and the occasional advice column. In her free time she writes plays. They’re all comedies.
