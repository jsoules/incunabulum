Luciana Savindar is a former member of the legendary adventuring group the Four Immortals, and the only one to have stayed in Wellspring after the group’s dissolution. She was awarded a minor noble title for her defense of the city during the last Sherem War, and has since retired to a manor in the Noble Quarter.

She is frequently found in the broadsheets, usually under “Scandals”, and is rumored to sneak into the city’s underground fighting rings under an alias. Her ideal evening is, in her own words, “a good drink, a good fight, and a good tumble”.
