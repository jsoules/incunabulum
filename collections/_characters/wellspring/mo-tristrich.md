  Shoal elf diviner and student of the arcane arts
description: |
  Mo is uncommonly short for her lineage, around 4’10” or 4’11”. Her jet-black hair falls to the base of her shoulder blades, and is loosely wavy (though she usually braids it). Her eyes are a deep brown. Her delicate features and large eyes resemble a porcelain doll’s; this, taken together with her short height and slim, almost boyish, build, often leads strangers to assume she is an adolescent. She hates this.

As a shoal elf, Mo grew up among people very comfortable with the sea, the outdoors, and each other. Possibly due to her resurgent magical bloodline, or possibly just due to her personality, she felt disconnected from her peers, and preferred staying indoors with books over boisterous socializing. Her family, reasonably prosperous merchants, originally sent her along on trading voyages as a supercargo, navigator. and quartermaster. While she loved the chance to see the world beyond her own community and learn the languages of several different trading partners, she unfortunately could never really get over seasickness, and returned to do accounting in the home office.

But there’s very little room for advancement when you work for your parents, your people have professional lives measured in the hundreds of years, and both your family and strangers alike treat you like a child. It was during this time–when she lived through books, and their depictions of the past and of far places, real and imagined–that she took to reading aloud and learning the basics of performance craft as a release from the daily tedium and a way to practice being someone else. Through it all she felt the pull of something greater: both of distant and different lands, and of the transcendent possibilities of the magic in her veins. Eventually she left for Wellspring to pursue that passion through an apprenticeship with its Arcane Order. Her family doesn’t really support this move (and certainly resent losing her accounting services), so she’s always on the lookout for a new hustle, so she can buy more books, make sure her tuition gets paid, get some rent together, and possibly buy food (in that order).
