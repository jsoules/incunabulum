Daragoth the Mojh was the mastermind behind the [Silverstone Theater Mystery]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures/silverstone-theater-mystery). Conniving and cruel, Daragoth displayed considerable talent at alchemy and transmutation, including fashioning guard drakes for themself out of scraps of draconic flesh. Ultimately, their greed and arrogance (not to mention inferiority complex) proved to be their downfall.
