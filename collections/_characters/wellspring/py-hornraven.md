Py grew up in a wandering troup of players, the daughter of an Elf who was the company’s props and combat master, and the company’s leader, a playwright and musician. She often assisted her parents and the rest of the troupe in their work, and by the time she was eight she was considered a go-to person if anything was broken or needed improvement. A few years later, a stranger joined the caravan as a handyperson. Py was instantly enthralled by the creations of this newcomer, and spent hours sitting by their side at the fire or any setup table, watching them work on intricate mechanisms that seemed to almost have a life of their own. After begging the stranger for weeks and demonstrating her skills, they took her on as something like an apprentice, and in this way Py learned the hidden arts of Artificery.

The stranger stayed with the caravan for a year, and Py spent every waking moment practicing her skills under their tutelage. After they parted company with the troupe, Py left the wandering theater to forge out on her own, eventually attracted to Wellspring’s magic and cosmopolitan (to her) population. She quickly developed a customer base with her skilled repairs to almost anything, and supports herself (and her theater/home’s prop closet) with her repair work. Py lives in the theater building in a room that is 90% workbench and parts. She believes in using technology to even the playing field, and will go out of her way to gain (borrow? steal?) interesting parts for her experiments, mostly believing that everything should be shared as it was in her caravan. She also has a habit of building and giving away assistance devices to those who can’t pay.
