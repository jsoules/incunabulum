    details: |
      Belak discovered the corrupted tree beneath the Sunless Citadel and sought to use its power, in the process releasing the twig blights onto the Sapphire Coast. He also co-opted the goblins, and slew and reanimated the adventurers from Oakhurst as wooden guardians.

A maddened druid in furs and wearing a stag's horns, Belak was the foe lurking at the heart of the Sunless Citadel. Before he was defeated, he raved about the awakening of the elements and claimed that his vampiric tree would provide a shelter of unlife where a few could survive the coming storm.
