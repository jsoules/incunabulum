A gruff loner of a ranger with a soft spot for music, Biren joined the party for the expedition into the [Sunless Citadel]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/lutes/setting/geography#the-sunless-citadel) with his wolf companion. He left again for the wilds afterward, concerned about Aoife's decision to keep Aurora the dragon. Sometime thereafter, Biren became trapped in the Feywild. When he returned, his wolf companion had become a fairy spirit.
