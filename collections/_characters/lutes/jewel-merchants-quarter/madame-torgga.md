Madame Torgga Deepstone is the head of the Deepstone Trading Company, the largest trading firm in the Sapphire Coast after the seizure of Montaigne Merchantry. Unusually for a dwarf, she is clean-shaven, "because humans get worked up about the stupidest things". Gruff and perpetually overworked, Madame Torgga has a keen sense for business matched by a deep care for her people.
