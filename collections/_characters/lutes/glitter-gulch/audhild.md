"Granny" Audhild was a retired adventurer, a semi-permanent fixture of Glitter Gulch who was equally adept at patching up injuries or metal. After the town was menaced by fire snakes, she took up her hammer again full time, seeking to proactively protect the place she now called home.

In an unguarded moment, Audhild will reference her original home, a dwarven city now lost. She will steadfastly refuse to answer questions, preferring to keep that part of her life in the past.
