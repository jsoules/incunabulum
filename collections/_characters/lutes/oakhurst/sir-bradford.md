A paladin of the Knights of the Dawn, Sir Bradford led a group of adventurers from Oakhurst into the Sunless Citadel. Unfortunately, he and his companions fell in its depths and were reanimated by Belak as plant-corrupted guardians of the vampiric tree at the Citadel's heart. In retrieving his sword, Aoife and Lily earned the gratitude of the knightly order.
