Taliesan is a junior scholar from the University of Amaranth, a member of the College of Antiquities. She arrived in the Sapphire Coast sometime before the summer solstice, searching for clues as to the location of the mythical Lost Library of the Druids. Her discoveries prompted a full expedition lead by Dean Artemisia herself.
