    details: |
      Yusdrayl was the chief of the kobolds in the Sunless Citadel. She negotiated with Aoife and Lily to allow passage in return for driving out the goblins deeper in the ruins, and if possible the return of the clan's "secret weapon", the baby dragon Calcryx. Aoife adopted the dragon instead, naming her Aurora.

Yusdrayl is a kobold with striking red scales and sorcerous powers, and acts as the leader of the kobold clan in the Sunless Citadel. With the rival goblins now fled and the mad druid Belak slain, they have consolidated their power and opened very cautious trade with the nearby town of Oakhurst.
